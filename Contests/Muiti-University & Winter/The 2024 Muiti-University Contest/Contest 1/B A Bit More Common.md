# A Bit More Common

## 题目描述

Given two integers $n$ and $m$, among all the sequences containing $n$ non-negative integers less than $2^m$, you need to count the number of such sequences $A$ that there exists **two different** non-empty subsequences of $A$ in each of which the bitwise AND of the integers is $1$.

Note that a non-empty subsequence of a sequence $A$ is a non-empty sequence that can be obtained by deleting zero or more elements from $A$ and arranging the remaining elements in their original order. **Two subsequences are different if they are composed of different locations in the original sequence**.

Since the answer may be very large, output it modulo a positive integer $q$.

The bitwise AND of non-negative integers $A$ and $B$, $A\ \texttt{AND}\ B$ is defined as follows:

- When $A\ \texttt{AND}\ B$ is written in base two, the digit in the $2^d$'s place ($d \ge 0$) is $1$ if those of $A$ and $B$ are **both** $1$, and $0$ otherwise.

For example, we have $4\ \texttt{AND}\ 6$ = $4$ (in base two: $100\ \texttt{AND}\ 110$ = $100$).

Generally, the bitwise AND of $k$ non-negative integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ is defined as
$(\ldots((p_1\ \texttt{AND}\ p_2)\ \texttt{AND}\ p_3)\ \texttt{AND}\ \ldots\ \texttt{AND}\ p_k)$
and we can prove that this value does not depend on the order of $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$.

## 输入描述
