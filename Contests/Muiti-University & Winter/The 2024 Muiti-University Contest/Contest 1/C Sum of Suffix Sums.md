# Sum of Suffix Sums

## 题目描述

Given an array which is initially empty, you need to perform $q$ operations:

- Given two non-negative integers $t$ and $v$, take out the element from the end of the array for $t$ times and then append $v$ to the end of the array. It is guaranteed that $t$ does not exceed the length of the array before this operation.

After each operation, let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ be the current array, find the **sum** of $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$, where $s_i = a_i + a_{i+1} + \ldots + a_n$ is the sum of the suffix starting from position $i$.

Since the answers may be very large, output them modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.

## 输入描述

The first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 5 \times 10^5$), denoting the number of operations.

Each of the following $q$ lines contains two non-negative integers $t$ and $v$ ($0 \le v \le 10^9$), describing an operation, where $t$ does not exceed the length of the array before this operation.

## 输出描述

Output $q$ lines, each of which contains an integer, denoting the answer.

## 说明

After the first operation, the current array is $[1]$, the suffix sum array is $[1]$, and the sum of the suffix sums is $1$.

After the second operation, the current array is $[1,2]$, the suffix sum array is $[3,2]$, and the sum of the suffix sums is $5$.

After the third operation, the current array is $[1,3]$, the suffix sum array is $[4,3]$, and the sum of the suffix sums is $7$.

After the fourth operation, the current array is $[1,3,6]$, the suffix sum array is $[10,9,6]$, and the sum of the suffix sums is $25$.

After the fifth operation, the current array is $[1,100\,000]$, the suffix sum array is $[100\,001,100\,000]$, and the sum of the suffix sums is $200\,001$.
