## 题目描述

Sakurako will soon take a test. The test can be described as an array of integers n$t$$n$ and a task on it:Given an integer x$t$$x$, Sakurako can perform the following operation any number of times: Choose an integer i$t$$i$ (1≤i≤n$t$$1\le i\le n$) such that ai≥x$t$$a_i\ge x$; Change the value of ai$t$$a_i$ to ai−x$t$$a_i-x$. Using this operation any number of times, she must find the minimum possible median∗$t$$^{\text{∗}}$ of the array a$t$$a$.Sakurako knows the array but does not know the integer x$t$$x$. Someone let it slip that one of the q$t$$q$ values of x$t$$x$ will be in the next test, so Sakurako is asking you what the answer is for each such x$t$$x$.∗$t$$^{\text{∗}}$The median of an array of length n$t$$n$ is the element that stands in the middle of the sorted array (at the n+22$t$$\frac{n+2}{2}$-th position for even n$t$$n$, and at the n+12$t$$\frac{n+1}{2}$-th for odd)

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer t$q$$t$ (1≤t≤104$q$$1\le t\le 10^4$)  — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers n$q$$n$ and q$q$$q$ (1≤n,q≤105$q$$1\le n,q\le 10^5$)  — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries.The second line of each test case contains n$q$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$q$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤n$q$$1\le a_i\le n$)  — the elements of the array.The following q$q$$q$ lines each contain one integer x$q$$x$ (1≤x≤n$q$$1\le x\le n$).It is guaranteed that the sum of n$q$$n$ across all test cases does not exceed 105$q$$10^5$. The same guarantee applies to the sum of q$q$$q$ across all test cases.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output qq$q$ integers  — the answer for each query.
