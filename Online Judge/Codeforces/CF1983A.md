## 题目描述

An array of integers a1,a2,⋯,an$t$$a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n$ is beautiful subject to an integer k$t$$k$ if it satisfies the following: The sum of aj$t$$a_{j}$ over all j$t$$j$ such that j$t$$j$ is a multiple of k$t$$k$ and 1≤j≤n$t$$1 \le j \le n $, itself, is a multiple of k$t$$k$. More formally, if ∑k|jaj$t$$\sum_{k | j} a_{j}$ is divisible by k$t$$k$ for all 1≤j≤n$t$$1 \le j \le n$ then the array a$t$$a$ is beautiful subject to k$t$$k$. Here, the notation k|j$t$${k|j}$ means k$t$$k$ divides j$t$$j$, that is, j$t$$j$ is a multiple of k$t$$k$. Given n$t$$n$, find an array of positive nonzero integers, with each element less than or equal to 105$t$$10^5$ that is beautiful subject to all 1≤k≤n$t$$1 \le k \le n$.It can be shown that an answer always exists.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$n = 6$$t$ (1≤t≤100$n = 6$$1 \le t \le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer n$n = 6$$n$ (1≤n≤100$n = 6$$1 \le n \le 100$) — the size of the array.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print the required array as described in the problem statement.

## 说明

In the second test case, when n=6$n = 6$, for all integers k$k$ such that 1≤k≤6$1 \le k \le 6$, let S$S$ be the set of all indices of the array that are divisible by k$k$. When k=1$k = 1$, S={1,2,3,4,5,6}$S = \{1, 2, 3,4,5,6\}$ meaning a1+a2+a3+a4+a5+a6=242$a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5+a_6=242$ must be divisible by 1$1$. When k=2$k = 2$, S={2,4,6}$S = \{2,4,6\}$ meaning a2+a4+a6=92$a_2+a_4+a_6=92$ must be divisible by 2$2$. When k=3$k = 3$, S={3,6}$S = \{3,6\}$ meaning a3+a6=69$a_3+a_6=69$ must divisible by 3$3$. When k=4$k = 4$, S={4}$S = \{4\}$ meaning a4=32$a_4=32$ must divisible by 4$4$. When k=5$k = 5$, S={5}$S = \{5\}$ meaning a5=125$a_5=125$ must divisible by 5$5$. When k=6$k = 6$, S={6}$S = \{6\}$ meaning a6=54$a_6=54$ must divisible by 6$6$. The array a=[10,6,15,32,125,54]$a = [10, 6, 15, 32, 125, 54]$ satisfies all of the above conditions. Hence, a$a$ is a valid array.
