## 题目描述

Freya the Frog is traveling on the 2D coordinate plane. She is currently at point $t$$(0,0)$ and wants to go to point $t$$(x,y)$. In one move, she chooses an integer $t$$d$ such that $t$$0 \leq d \leq k$ and jumps $t$$d$ spots forward in the direction she is facing. Initially, she is facing the positive $t$$x$ direction. After every move, she will alternate between facing the positive $t$$x$ direction and the positive $t$$y$ direction (i.e., she will face the positive $t$$y$ direction on her second move, the positive $t$$x$ direction on her third move, and so on). What is the minimum amount of moves she must perform to land on point $t$$(x,y)$?

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $0,0$$t$ ($0,0$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.Each test case contains three integers $0,0$$x$, $0,0$$y$, and $0,0$$k$ ($0,0$$0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9, 1 \leq k \leq 10^9$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the number of jumps Freya needs to make on a new line.

## 说明

In the first sample, one optimal set of moves is if Freya jumps in the following way: (0,00,0$0,0$) →→$\rightarrow$ (2,02,0$2,0$) →→$\rightarrow$ (2,22,2$2,2$) →→$\rightarrow$ (3,23,2$3,2$) →→$\rightarrow$ (3,53,5$3,5$) →→$\rightarrow$ (6,56,5$6,5$) →→$\rightarrow$ (6,86,8$6,8$) →→$\rightarrow$ (9,89,8$9,8$) →→$\rightarrow$ (9,119,11$9,11$). This takes 8 jumps.
