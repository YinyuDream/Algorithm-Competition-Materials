## 题目描述

You are given a two-dimensional plane, and you need to place n$t$$n$ chips on it. You can place a chip only at a point with integer coordinates. The cost of placing a chip at the point (x,y)$t$$(x, y)$ is equal to |x|+|y|$t$$|x| + |y|$ (where |a|$t$$|a|$ is the absolute value of a$t$$a$).The cost of placing n$t$$n$ chips is equal to the maximum among the costs of each chip.You need to place n$t$$n$ chips on the plane in such a way that the Euclidean distance between each pair of chips is strictly greater than 1$t$$1$, and the cost is the minimum possible.

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer t$n$$t$ (1≤t≤104$n$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Next t$n$$t$ cases follow.The first and only line of each test case contains one integer n$n$$n$ (1≤n≤1018$n$$1 \le n \le 10^{18}$) — the number of chips you need to place.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum cost to place n$(0, 0)$$n$ chips if the distance between each pair of chips must be strictly greater than 1$(0, 0)$$1$.

## 说明

In the first test case, you can place the only chip at point (0,0)(0,0)$(0, 0)$ with total cost equal to 0+0=00+0=0$0 + 0 = 0$.In the second test case, you can, for example, place chips at points (−1,0)(−1,0)$(-1, 0)$, (0,1)(0,1)$(0, 1)$ and (1,0)(1,0)$(1, 0)$ with costs |−1|+|0|=1|−1|+|0|=1$|-1| + |0| = 1$, |0|+|1|=1|0|+|1|=1$|0| + |1| = 1$ and |0|+|1|=1|0|+|1|=1$|0| + |1| = 1$. Distance between each pair of chips is greater than 11$1$ (for example, distance between (−1,0)(−1,0)$(-1, 0)$ and (0,1)(0,1)$(0, 1)$ is equal to √22–√$\sqrt{2}$). The total cost is equal to max(1,1,1)=1max(1,1,1)=1$\max(1, 1, 1) = 1$.In the third test case, you can, for example, place chips at points (−1,−1)(−1,−1)$(-1, -1)$, (−1,1)(−1,1)$(-1, 1)$, (1,1)(1,1)$(1, 1)$, (0,0)(0,0)$(0, 0)$ and (0,2)(0,2)$(0, 2)$. The total cost is equal to max(2,2,2,0,2)=2max(2,2,2,0,2)=2$\max(2, 2, 2, 0, 2) = 2$.
