## 题目描述

You are given two integers $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$n$ and $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$k$ along with a string $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$s$.Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$n$ that can be formed using the first $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$k$ lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$s$. If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$n$ that can be formed using the first $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$k$ lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$s$.If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.Note: A string $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$a$ is called a subsequence of another string $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$b$ if $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$a$ can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from $t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$$b$ without changing the order of the remaining characters.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer $n$$t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5)$, the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains $n$$3$ integers $n$$n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \: k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000)$, where $n$$n$ and $n$$k$ are the same as described in the input and $n$$m$ is the length of the string $n$$s$.The second line of each test case contains a single string $n$$s$ of length $n$$m$, comprising only of the first $n$$k$ lowercase English alphabets.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$$m$ and the sum of $n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $n$$10^6$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length $2$$n$ that can be formed using the first $2$$k$ lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of $2$$s$, else print NO.If your answer is NO, print a string of length $2$$n$ that can be formed using the first $2$$k$ lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of $2$$s$ in the next line.You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS will all be recognized as a positive answer).

## 说明

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 22$2$ that can be formed using the first 22$2$ English alphabets occur as a subsequence of abba.For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.
