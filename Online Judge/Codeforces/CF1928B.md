## 题目描述

Vasya has two hobbies — adding permutations$t$$^{\dagger}$ to arrays and finding the most frequently occurring element. Recently, he found an array $t$$a$ and decided to find out the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array $t$$a$ that he can obtain after adding some permutation to the array $t$$a$.More formally, Vasya must choose exactly one permutation $t$$p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$ of length $t$$n$, and then change the elements of the array $t$$a$ according to the rule $t$$a_i := a_i + p_i$. After that, Vasya counts how many times each number occurs in the array $t$$a$ and takes the maximum of these values. You need to determine the maximum value he can obtain.$t$$^{\dagger}$A permutation of length $t$$n$ is an array consisting of $t$$n$ distinct integers from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $t$$[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $t$$[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($t$$2$ appears twice in the array), and $t$$[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($t$$n=3$ but there is $t$$4$ in the array).

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $p = [2, 1]$$t$ ($p = [2, 1]$$1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $p = [2, 1]$$n$ ($p = [2, 1]$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the array $p = [2, 1]$$a$.The second line of each test case contains $p = [2, 1]$$n$ integers $p = [2, 1]$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($p = [2, 1]$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the elements of the array $p = [2, 1]$$a$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $p = [2, 1]$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $p = [2, 1]$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after the operation of adding a permutation.

## 说明

In the first test case, it is optimal to choose p=[2,1]p=[2,1]$p = [2, 1]$. Then after applying the operation, the array aa$a$ will be [3,3][3,3]$[3, 3]$, in which the number 33$3$ occurs twice, so the answer is 22$2$.In the second test case, one of the optimal options is p=[2,3,1,4]p=[2,3,1,4]$p = [2, 3, 1, 4]$. After applying the operation, the array aa$a$ will be [9,4,5,5][9,4,5,5]$[9, 4, 5, 5]$. Since the number 55$5$ occurs twice, the answer is 22$2$.
