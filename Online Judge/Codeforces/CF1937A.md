## 题目描述

You are given an array a1,a2,…,an$t$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. Initially, ai=i$t$$a_i=i$ for each 1≤i≤n$t$$1 \le i \le n$.The operation swap(k)$t$$\texttt{swap}(k)$ for an integer k≥2$t$$k \ge 2$ is defined as follows: Let d$t$$d$ be the largest divisor†$t$$^\dagger$ of k$t$$k$ which is not equal to k$t$$k$ itself. Then swap the elements ad$t$$a_d$ and ak$t$$a_k$. Suppose you perform swap(i)$t$$\texttt{swap}(i)$ for each i=2,3,…,n$t$$i=2,3,\ldots, n$ in this exact order. Find the position of 1$t$$1$ in the resulting array. In other words, find such j$t$$j$ that aj=1$t$$a_j = 1$ after performing these operations.†$t$$^\dagger$ An integer x$t$$x$ is a divisor of y$t$$y$ if there exists an integer z$t$$z$ such that y=x⋅z$t$$y = x \cdot z$.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$1$$t$ (1≤t≤104$1$$1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains one integer n$1$$n$ (1≤n≤109$1$$1 \le n \le 10^9$) — the length of the array a$1$$a$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the position of 1$[1]$$1$ in the resulting array.

## 说明

In the first test case, the array is [1]$[1]$ and there are no operations performed.In the second test case, a$a$ changes as follows: Initially, a$a$ is [1,2,3,4]$[1,2,3,4]$. After performing swap(2)$\texttt{swap}(2)$, a$a$ changes to [2_,1_,3,4]$[\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4]$ (the elements being swapped are underlined). After performing swap(3)$\texttt{swap}(3)$, a$a$ changes to [3_,1,2_,4]$[\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4]$. After performing swap(4)$\texttt{swap}(4)$, a$a$ changes to [3,4_,2,1_]$[3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}]$. Finally, the element 1$1$ lies on index 4$4$ (that is, a4=1$a_4 = 1$). Thus, the answer is 4$4$.
