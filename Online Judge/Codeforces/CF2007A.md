## 题目描述

Dora has a set s$t$$s$ containing integers. In the beginning, she will put all integers in [l,r]$t$$[l, r]$ into the set s$t$$s$. That is, an integer x$t$$x$ is initially contained in the set if and only if l≤x≤r$t$$l \leq x \leq r$. Then she allows you to perform the following operations: Select three distinct integers a$t$$a$, b$t$$b$, and c$t$$c$ from the set s$t$$s$, such that gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,c)=gcd(a,c)=1†$t$$\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, c) = \gcd(a, c) = 1^\dagger$. Then, remove these three integers from the set s$t$$s$. What is the maximum number of operations you can perform?†$t$$^\dagger$Recall that gcd(x,y)$t$$\gcd(x, y)$ means the greatest common divisor of integers x$t$$x$ and y$t$$y$.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t$a = 1$$t$ (1≤t≤500$a = 1$$1 \leq t \leq 500$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers l$a = 1$$l$ and r$a = 1$$r$ (1≤l≤r≤1000$a = 1$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq 1000$) — the range of integers in the initial set.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of operations you can perform.

## 说明

In the first test case, you can choose a=1$a = 1$, b=2$b = 2$, c=3$c = 3$ in the only operation, since gcd(1,2)=gcd(2,3)=gcd(1,3)=1$\gcd(1, 2) = \gcd(2, 3) = \gcd(1, 3) = 1$, and then there are no more integers in the set, so no more operations can be performed.In the second test case, you can choose a=3$a = 3$, b=5$b = 5$, c=7$c = 7$ in the only operation.In the third test case, you can choose a=11$a = 11$, b=19$b = 19$, c=20$c = 20$ in the first operation, a=13$a = 13$, b=14$b = 14$, c=15$c = 15$ in the second operation, and a=10$a = 10$, b=17$b = 17$, c=21$c = 21$ in the third operation. After the three operations, the set s$s$ contains the following integers: 12$12$, 16$16$, 18$18$. It can be proven that it's impossible to perform more than 3$3$ operations.
