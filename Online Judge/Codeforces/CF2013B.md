## 题目描述

Eralim, being the mafia boss, manages a group of n$t$$n$ fighters. Fighter i$t$$i$ has a rating of ai$t$$a_i$.Eralim arranges a tournament of n−1$t$$n - 1$ battles, in each of which two not yet eliminated fighters i$t$$i$ and j$t$$j$ (1≤i<j≤n$t$$1 \le i < j \le n$) are chosen, and as a result of the battle, fighter i$t$$i$ is eliminated from the tournament, and the rating of fighter j$t$$j$ is reduced by the rating of fighter i$t$$i$. That is, aj$t$$a_j$ is decreased by ai$t$$a_i$. Note that fighter j$t$$j$'s rating can become negative. The fighters indexes do not change.Eralim wants to know what maximum rating the last remaining fighter can preserve if he chooses the battles optimally.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$1$$t$ (1≤t≤104$1$$1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$1$$n$ (2≤n≤2⋅105$1$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of fighters.The second line of each test case contains n$1$$n$ integers a1,a2,…an$1$$a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n$ (1≤ai≤109$1$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the ratings of the fighters.The sum of n$1$$n$ over all testcases does not exceed 2⋅105$1$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each testcase, output a single integer — the maximum rating that the last remaining fighter can preserve.

## 说明

In the first example, you can arrange a fight between fighters with indices 11$1$ and 22$2$, where the fighter with index 22$2$ will win. The rating of the last fighter, that is, the fighter with index 22$2$, will be 1−2=−11−2=−1$1 - 2 = -1$.In the second example, you can first conduct a fight between fighters with indices 11$1$ and 22$2$, where the fighter with index 22$2$ will win, and then conduct a fight between fighters with indices 22$2$ and 33$3$, where the fighter with index 33$3$ will win.The rating of the fighter with index 22$2$ after the first fight will be 2−2=02−2=0$2 - 2 = 0$. The rating of the fighter with index 33$3$ after the second fight will be 8−0=88−0=8$8 - 0 = 8$.
