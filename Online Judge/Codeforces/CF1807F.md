## 题目描述

You are given a room that can be represented by a $t$$n \times m$ grid. There is a ball at position $t$$(i_1, j_1)$ (the intersection of row $t$$i_1$ and column $t$$j_1$), and it starts going diagonally in one of the four directions: The ball is going down and right, denoted by $t$$\texttt{DR}$; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from $t$$(i, j)$ to $t$$(i+1, j+1)$. The ball is going down and left, denoted by $t$$\texttt{DL}$; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from $t$$(i, j)$ to $t$$(i+1, j-1)$. The ball is going up and right, denoted by $t$$\texttt{UR}$; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from $t$$(i, j)$ to $t$$(i-1, j+1)$. The ball is going up and left, denoted by $t$$\texttt{UL}$; it means that after a step, the ball's location goes from $t$$(i, j)$ to $t$$(i-1, j-1)$. After each step, the ball maintains its direction unless it hits a wall (that is, the direction takes it out of the room's bounds in the next step). In this case, the ball's direction gets flipped along the axis of the wall; if the ball hits a corner, both directions get flipped. Any instance of this is called a bounce. The ball never stops moving. In the above example, the ball starts at $t$$(1, 7)$ and goes $t$$\texttt{DL}$ until it reaches the bottom wall, then it bounces and continues in the direction $t$$\texttt{UL}$. After reaching the left wall, the ball bounces and continues to go in the direction $t$$\texttt{UR}$. When the ball reaches the upper wall, it bounces and continues in the direction $t$$\texttt{DR}$. After reaching the bottom-right corner, it bounces once and continues in direction $t$$\texttt{UL}$, and so on.Your task is to find how many bounces the ball will go through until it reaches cell $t$$(i_2, j_2)$ in the room, or report that it never reaches cell $t$$(i_2, j_2)$ by printing $t$$-1$.Note that the ball first goes in a cell and only after that bounces if it needs to.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $(i_2, j_2)$$t$ ($(i_2, j_2)$$1 \leq t \leq 1000$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains six integers and a string $(i_2, j_2)$$n, m, i_1, j_1, i_2, j_2, d$ ($(i_2, j_2)$$2 \leq n, m \leq 25000$; $(i_2, j_2)$$1 \leq i_1, i_2 \leq n$; $(i_2, j_2)$$1 \leq j_1, j_2 \leq m$; $(i_2, j_2)$$d \in\{ \texttt{DR}, \texttt{DL}, \texttt{UR}, \texttt{UL}\}$) — the dimensions of the grid, the starting coordinates of the ball, the coordinates of the final cell and the starting direction of the ball.It is guaranteed that the sum of $(i_2, j_2)$$n \cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $(i_2, j_2)$$5 \cdot 10^4$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of bounces the ball does until it reaches cell (i2,j2)$(i_2, j_2)$ for the first time, or −1$-1$ if the ball never reaches the final cell.
