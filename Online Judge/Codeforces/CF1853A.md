## 题目描述

Call an array $t$$a$ of length $t$$n$ sorted if $t$$a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n-1} \leq a_n$.Ntarsis has an array $t$$a$ of length $t$$n$. He is allowed to perform one type of operation on it (zero or more times): Choose an index $t$$i$ ($t$$1 \leq i \leq n-1$). Add $t$$1$ to $t$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_i$. Subtract $t$$1$ from $t$$a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, \ldots, a_n$. The values of $t$$a$ can be negative after an operation.Determine the minimum operations needed to make $t$$a$ not sorted.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $1$$t$ ($1$$1 \le t \le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $1$$n$ ($1$$2 \leq n \leq 500$) — the length of the array $1$$a$.The next line contains $1$$n$ integers $1$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the values of array $1$$a$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $1$$n$ across all test cases does not exceed $1$$500$.

## 输出格式

Output the minimum number of operations needed to make the array not sorted.

## 说明

In the first case, we can perform 1$1$ operation to make the array not sorted: Pick i=1$i = 1$. The array a$a$ then becomes [2,0]$[2, 0]$, which is not sorted. In the second case, we can perform 2$2$ operations to make the array not sorted: Pick i=3$i = 3$. The array a$a$ then becomes [2,9,11,12]$[2, 9, 11, 12]$. Pick i=3$i = 3$. The array a$a$ then becomes [3,10,12,11]$[3, 10, 12, 11]$, which is not sorted. It can be proven that 1$1$ and 2$2$ operations are the minimal numbers of operations in the first and second test cases, respectively.In the third case, the array is already not sorted, so we perform 0$0$ operations.
