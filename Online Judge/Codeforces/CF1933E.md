## 题目描述

Isaac begins his training. There are $t$$n$ running tracks available, and the $t$$i$-th track ($t$$1 \le i \le n$) consists of $t$$a_i$ equal-length sections. Given an integer $t$$u$ ($t$$1 \le u \le 10^9$), finishing each section can increase Isaac's ability by a certain value, described as follows: Finishing the $t$$1$-st section increases Isaac's performance by $t$$u$. Finishing the $t$$2$-nd section increases Isaac's performance by $t$$u-1$. Finishing the $t$$3$-rd section increases Isaac's performance by $t$$u-2$. $t$$\ldots$ Finishing the $t$$k$-th section ($t$$k \ge 1$) increases Isaac's performance by $t$$u+1-k$. (The value $t$$u+1-k$ can be negative, which means finishing an extra section decreases Isaac's performance.) You are also given an integer $t$$l$. You must choose an integer $t$$r$ such that $t$$l \le r \le n$ and Isaac will finish each section of each track $t$$l, l + 1, \dots, r$ (that is, a total of $t$$\sum_{i=l}^r a_i = a_l + a_{l+1} + \ldots + a_r$ sections).Answer the following question: what is the optimal $t$$r$ you can choose that the increase in Isaac's performance is maximum possible? If there are multiple $t$$r$ that maximize the increase in Isaac's performance, output the smallest $t$$r$.To increase the difficulty, you need to answer the question for $t$$q$ different values of $t$$l$ and $t$$u$.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer $q$$t$ ($q$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line contains a single integer $q$$n$ ($q$$1 \le n \le 10^5$). The second line contains $q$$n$ integers $q$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($q$$1 \le a_i \le 10^4$).The third line contains a single integer $q$$q$ ($q$$1 \le q \le 10^5$).The next $q$$q$ lines each contain two integers $q$$l$ and $q$$u$ ($q$$1 \le l \le n, 1 \le u \le 10^9$) — the descriptions to each query.The sum of $q$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $q$$2 \cdot 10^5$. The sum of $q$$q$ over all test cases does not exceed $q$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output $1$$q$ integers: the $1$$i$-th integer contains the optimal $1$$r$ for the $1$$i$-th query. If there are multiple solutions, output the smallest one.

## 说明

For the 11$1$-st query in the first test case: By choosing r=3r=3$r = 3$, Isaac finishes a1+a2+a3=3+1+4=8a1+a2+a3=3+1+4=8$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is u+(u−1)+…+(u−7)=8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1=36u+(u−1)+…+(u−7)=8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1=36$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-7)=8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 36$. By choosing r=4r=4$r = 4$, Isaac finishes a1+a2+a3+a4=3+1+4+1=9a1+a2+a3+a4=3+1+4+1=9$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is u+(u−1)+…+(u−8)=8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1+0=36u+(u−1)+…+(u−8)=8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1+0=36$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-8)=8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1+0 = 36$. Both choices yield the optimal increase in performance, however we want to choose the smallest rr$r$. So we choose r=3r=3$r = 3$.For the 22$2$-nd query in the first test case, by choosing r=4r=4$r = 4$, Isaac finishes a2+a3+a4=1+4+1=6a2+a3+a4=1+4+1=6$a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is u+(u−1)+…+(u−5)=7+6+5+4+3+2=27u+(u−1)+…+(u−5)=7+6+5+4+3+2=27$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-5)=7+6+5+4+3+2 = 27$. This is the optimal increase in performance.For the 33$3$-rd query in the first test case: By choosing r=5r=5$r = 5$, Isaac finishes a5=5a5=5$a_5 = 5$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is u+(u−1)+…+(u−4)=9+8+7+6+5=35u+(u−1)+…+(u−4)=9+8+7+6+5=35$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-4)=9+8+7+6+5 = 35$. By choosing r=6r=6$r = 6$, Isaac finishes a5+a6=5+9=14a5+a6=5+9=14$a_5 + a_6 = 5 + 9 = 14$ sections in total, hence his increase in performance is u+(u−1)+…+(u−13)=9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1+0+(−1)+(−2)+(−3)+(−4)=35u+(u−1)+…+(u−13)=9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1+0+(−1)+(−2)+(−3)+(−4)=35$u+(u-1)+\ldots+(u-13)=9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1+0+(-1)+(-2)+(-3)+(-4) = 35$. Both choices yield the optimal increase in performance, however we want to choose the smallest rr$r$. So we choose r=5r=5$r = 5$.Hence the output for the first test case is [3,4,5][3,4,5]$[3, 4, 5]$.
