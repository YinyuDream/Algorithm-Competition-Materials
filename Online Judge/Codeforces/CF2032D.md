## 题目描述

This is an interactive problem.Upon clearing the Waterside Area, Gretel has found a monster named Genokraken, and she's keeping it contained for her scientific studies.The monster's nerve system can be structured as a tree$t$$^{\dagger}$ of $t$$n$ nodes (really, everything should stop resembling trees all the time$t$$\ldots$), numbered from $t$$0$ to $t$$n-1$, with node $t$$0$ as the root.Gretel's objective is to learn the exact structure of the monster's nerve system — more specifically, she wants to know the values $t$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{n-1}$ of the tree, where $t$$p_i$ ($t$$0 \le p_i < i$) is the direct parent node of node $t$$i$ ($t$$1 \le i \le n - 1$).She doesn't know exactly how the nodes are placed, but she knows a few convenient facts: If we remove root node $t$$0$ and all adjacent edges, this tree will turn into a forest consisting of only paths$t$$^{\ddagger}$. Each node that was initially adjacent to the node $t$$0$ will be the end of some path. The nodes are indexed in a way that if $t$$1 \le x \le y \le n - 1$, then $t$$p_x \le p_y$. Node $t$$1$ has exactly two adjacent nodes (including the node $t$$0$). The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because if we remove node $t$$0$, then node $t$$2$ (which was initially adjacent to the node $t$$0$) will not be the end of the path $t$$4-2-5$.The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because $t$$p_3 \le p_4$ must hold.The tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, because node $t$$1$ has only one adjacent node. Gretel can make queries to the containment cell: "? a b" ($t$$1 \le a, b < n$, $t$$a \ne b$) — the cell will check if the simple path between nodes $t$$a$ and $t$$b$ contains the node $t$$0$. However, to avoid unexpected consequences by overstimulating the creature, Gretel wants to query at most $t$$2n - 6$ times. Though Gretel is gifted, she can't do everything all at once, so can you give her a helping hand?$t$$^{\dagger}$A tree is a connected graph where every pair of distinct nodes has exactly one simple path connecting them.$t$$^{\ddagger}$A path is a tree whose vertices can be listed in the order $t$$v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k$ such that the edges are $t$$(v_i, v_{i+1})$ ($t$$1 \le i < k$).

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \le t \le 500$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$$n$ ($n$$4 \le n \le 10^4$) — the number of nodes in Genokraken's nerve system.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $n$$10^4$.

## 说明

In the first test case, Genokraken's nerve system forms the following tree: The answer to "? 2 3" is 11$1$. This means that the simple path between nodes 22$2$ and 33$3$ contains node 00$0$. In the second test case, Genokraken's nerve system forms the following tree: The answer to "? 2 3" is 11$1$. This means that the simple path between nodes 22$2$ and 33$3$ contains node 00$0$. The answer to "? 2 4" is 00$0$. This means that the simple path between nodes 22$2$ and 44$4$ doesn't contain node 00$0$. In the third test case, Genokraken's nerve system forms the following tree:
