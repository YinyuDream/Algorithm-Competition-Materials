## 题目描述

Recently, akshiM met a task that needed binomial coefficients to solve. He wrote a code he usually does that looked like this: for (int n = 0; n < N; n++) { // loop over n from 0 to N-1 (inclusive) C[n][0] = 1; C[n][n] = 1; for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) // loop over k from 1 to n-1 (inclusive) C[n][k] = C[n][k - 1] + C[n - 1][k - 1]; }Unfortunately, he made an error, since the right formula is the following: C[n][k] = C[n - 1][k] + C[n - 1][k - 1]But his team member keblidA is interested in values that were produced using the wrong formula. Please help him to calculate these coefficients for t$t$$t$ various pairs (ni,ki)$t$$(n_i, k_i)$. Note that they should be calculated according to the first (wrong) formula.Since values C[ni][ki]$t$$C[n_i][k_i]$ may be too large, print them modulo 109+7$t$$10^9 + 7$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$t$$t$ (1≤t≤105$t$$1 \le t \le 10^5$) — the number of pairs. Next, t$t$$t$ pairs are written in two lines.The second line contains t$t$$t$ integers n1,n2,…,nt$t$$n_1, n_2, \dots, n_t$ (2≤ni≤105$t$$2 \le n_i \le 10^5$).The third line contains t$t$$t$ integers k1,k2,…,kt$t$$k_1, k_2, \dots, k_t$ (1≤ki<ni$t$$1 \le k_i < n_i$).

## 输出格式

Print t$t$ integers C[ni][ki]$C[n_i][k_i]$ modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$.
