## 题目描述

There are $t$$n$ people on the number line; the $t$$i$-th person is at point $t$$a_i$ and wants to go to point $t$$b_i$. For each person, $t$$a_i < b_i$, and the starting and ending points of all people are distinct. (That is, all of the $t$$2n$ numbers $t$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ are distinct.) All the people will start moving simultaneously at a speed of $t$$1$ unit per second until they reach their final point $t$$b_i$. When two people meet at the same point, they will greet each other once. How many greetings will there be?Note that a person can still greet other people even if they have reached their final point.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $3$$t$ ($3$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $3$$n$ ($3$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of people.Then $3$$n$ lines follow, the $3$$i$-th of which contains two integers $3$$a_i$ and $3$$b_i$ ($3$$-10^9 \leq a_i < b_i \leq 10^9$) — the starting and ending positions of each person.For each test case, all of the $3$$2n$ numbers $3$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ are distinct.The sum of $3$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer denoting the number of greetings that will happen.
