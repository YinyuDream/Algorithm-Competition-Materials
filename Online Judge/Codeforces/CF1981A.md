## 题目描述

Turtle and Piggy are playing a number game.First, Turtle will choose an integer x$t$$x$, such that l≤x≤r$t$$l \le x \le r$, where l,r$t$$l, r$ are given. It's also guaranteed that 2l≤r$t$$2l \le r$.Then, Piggy will keep doing the following operation until x$t$$x$ becomes 1$t$$1$: Choose an integer p$t$$p$ such that p≥2$t$$p \ge 2$ and p∣x$t$$p \mid x$ (i.e. x$t$$x$ is a multiple of p$t$$p$). Set x$t$$x$ to xp$t$$\frac{x}{p}$, and the score will increase by 1$t$$1$. The score is initially 0$t$$0$. Both Turtle and Piggy want to maximize the score. Please help them to calculate the maximum score.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$x$$t$ (1≤t≤104$x$$1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers l,r$x$$l, r$ (1≤l≤r≤109,2l≤r$x$$1 \le l \le r \le 10^9, 2l \le r$) — The range where Turtle can choose the integer from.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum score.

## 说明

In the first test case, Turtle can choose an integer x$x$, such that 2≤x≤4$2 \le x \le 4$. He can choose x=4$x = 4$. Then Piggy can choose p=2$p = 2$ for 2$2$ times. After that, x$x$ will become 1$1$, and the score will be 2$2$, which is maximized.In the second test case, Turtle can choose an integer 3≤x≤6$3 \le x \le 6$. He can choose x=6$x = 6$. Then Piggy can choose p=2$p = 2$, then choose p=3$p = 3$. After that, x$x$ will become 1$1$, and the score will be 2$2$, which is maximum.In the third test case, Turtle can choose x=12$x = 12$.In the fourth test case, Turtle can choose x=16$x = 16$.
