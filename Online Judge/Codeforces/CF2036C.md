## 题目描述

While rummaging through things in a distant drawer, Anya found a beautiful string s$t$$s$ consisting only of zeros and ones.Now she wants to make it even more beautiful by performing q$t$$q$ operations on it.Each operation is described by two integers i$t$$i$ (1≤i≤|s|$t$$1 \le i \le |s|$) and v$t$$v$ (v∈{0,1}$t$$v \in \{0, 1\}$) and means that the i$t$$i$-th character of the string is assigned the value v$t$$v$ (that is, the assignment si=v$t$$s_i = v$ is performed).But Anya loves the number 1100$t$$1100$, so after each query, she asks you to tell her whether the substring "1100" is present in her string (i.e. there exist such 1≤i≤|s|−3$t$$1 \le i \le |s| - 3$ that sisi+1si+2si+3=1100$t$$s_{i}s_{i + 1}s_{i + 2}s_{i + 3} = \texttt{1100}$).

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer t$t$ (1≤t≤104$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of the test case contains the string s$s$ (1≤|s|≤2⋅105$1 \leq |s| \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$), consisting only of the characters "0" and "1". Here |s|$|s|$ denotes the length of the string s$s$.The next line contains an integer q$q$ (1≤q≤2⋅105$1 \leq q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries.The following q$q$ lines contain two integers i$i$ (1≤i≤|s|$1 \leq i \leq |s|$) and v$v$ (v∈{0,1}$v \in \{0, 1\}$), describing the query.It is guaranteed that the sum of |s|$|s|$ across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$2 \cdot 10^5$. It is also guaranteed that the sum of q$q$ across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each query, output "YES", if "1100" is present in Anya's string; otherwise, output "NO".You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
