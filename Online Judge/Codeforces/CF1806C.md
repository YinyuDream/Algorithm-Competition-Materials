## 题目描述

For some positive integer $t$$m$, YunQian considers an array $t$$q$ of $t$$2m$ (possibly negative) integers good, if and only if for every possible subsequence of $t$$q$ that has length $t$$m$, the product of the $t$$m$ elements in the subsequence is equal to the sum of the $t$$m$ elements that are not in the subsequence. Formally, let $t$$U=\{1,2,\ldots,2m\}$. For all sets $t$$S \subseteq U$ such that $t$$|S|=m$, $t$$\prod\limits_{i \in S} q_i = \sum\limits_{i \in U \setminus S} q_i$.Define the distance between two arrays $t$$a$ and $t$$b$ both of length $t$$k$ to be $t$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^k|a_i-b_i|$.You are given a positive integer $t$$n$ and an array $t$$p$ of $t$$2n$ integers.Find the minimum distance between $t$$p$ and $t$$q$ over all good arrays $t$$q$ of length $t$$2n$. It can be shown for all positive integers $t$$n$, at least one good array exists. Note that you are not required to construct the array $t$$q$ that achieves this minimum distance.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $p$$t$ ($p$$1\le t\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $p$$n$ ($p$$1\le n\le 2\cdot10^5$).The second line of each test case contains $p$$2n$ integers $p$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{2n}$ ($p$$|p_i| \le 10^9$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $p$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $p$$2\cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the minimum distance between $q=[6,6]$$p$ and a good $q=[6,6]$$q$.

## 说明

In the first test case, it is optimal to let q=[6,6]$q=[6,6]$.In the second test case, it is optimal to let q=[2,2,2,2]$q=[2,2,2,2]$.
