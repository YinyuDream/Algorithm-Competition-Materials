## 题目描述

Djjaner - Speedbreaker⠀There are n$t$$n$ cities in a row, numbered 1,2,…,n$t$$1, 2, \ldots, n$ left to right. At time 1$t$$1$, you conquer exactly one city, called the starting city. At time 2,3,…,n$t$$2, 3, \ldots, n$, you can choose a city adjacent to the ones conquered so far and conquer it. You win if, for each i$t$$i$, you conquer city i$t$$i$ at a time no later than ai$t$$a_i$. A winning strategy may or may not exist, also depending on the starting city. How many starting cities allow you to win?

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$2$$t$ (1≤t≤104$2$$1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$2$$n$ (1≤n≤2⋅105$2$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of cities.The second line of each test case contains n$2$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$2$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤n$2$$1 \le a_i \le n$) — the deadlines for conquering the cities.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$2$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$2$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer: the number of starting cities that allow you to win.

## 说明

In the first test case, cities 2$2$, 3$3$, and 4$4$ are good starting cities.In the second test case, there are no good starting cities.In the third test case, the only good starting city is city 5$5$.
