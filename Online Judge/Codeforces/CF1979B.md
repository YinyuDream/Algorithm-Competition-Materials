## 题目描述

You are given two distinct non-negative integers x$t$$x$ and y$t$$y$. Consider two infinite sequences a1,a2,a3,…$t$$a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ and b1,b2,b3,…$t$$b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots$, where an=n⊕x$t$$a_n = n \oplus x$; bn=n⊕y$t$$b_n = n \oplus y$. Here, x⊕y$t$$x \oplus y$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation of integers x$t$$x$ and y$t$$y$.For example, with x=6$t$$x = 6$, the first 8$t$$8$ elements of sequence a$t$$a$ will look as follows: [7,4,5,2,3,0,1,14,…]$t$$[7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots]$. Note that the indices of elements start with 1$t$$1$.Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment†$t$$^\dagger$ of sequences a$t$$a$ and b$t$$b$. In other words, find the maximum integer m$t$$m$ such that ai=bj,ai+1=bj+1,…,ai+m−1=bj+m−1$t$$a_i = b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1}$ for some i,j≥1$t$$i, j \ge 1$.†$t$$^\dagger$A subsegment of sequence p$t$$p$ is a sequence pl,pl+1,…,pr$t$$p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r$, where 1≤l≤r$t$$1 \le l \le r$.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t$7$$t$ (1≤t≤104$7$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers x$7$$x$ and y$7$$y$ (0≤x,y≤109,x≠y$7$$0 \le x, y \le 10^9, x \neq y$) — the parameters of the sequences.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common subsegment.

## 说明

In the first test case, the first 7$7$ elements of sequences a$a$ and b$b$ are as follows:a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,…]$a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]$b=[0,3,2,5,4,7,6,…]$b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]$It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k$k$ such that the sequence [k,k+1]$[k, k + 1]$ occurs in b$b$ as a subsegment. So the answer is 1$1$.In the third test case, the first 20$20$ elements of sequences a$a$ and b$b$ are as follows:a=[56,59,58,61,60,63,62,49,48,51,50,53,52,55,54,41, 40, 43, 42,45,…]$a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]$b=[36,39,38,33,32,35,34,45,44,47,46,41, 40, 43, 42,53,52,55,54,49,…]$b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53, 52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]$It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment [41,40,43,42]$[41, 40, 43, 42]$ with a length of 4$4$.
