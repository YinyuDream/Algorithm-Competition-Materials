## 题目描述

Alex got a new game called "GCD permutations" as a birthday present. Each round of this game proceeds as follows: First, Alex chooses a permutation$t$$^{\dagger}$ $t$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of integers from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$. Then, for each $t$$i$ from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$, an integer $t$$d_i = \gcd(a_i, a_{(i \bmod n) + 1})$ is calculated. The score of the round is the number of distinct numbers among $t$$d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$. Alex has already played several rounds so he decided to find a permutation $t$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ such that its score is as large as possible.Recall that $t$$\gcd(x, y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of numbers $t$$x$ and $t$$y$, and $t$$x \bmod y$ denotes the remainder of dividing $t$$x$ by $t$$y$.$t$$^{\dagger}$A permutation of length $t$$n$ is an array consisting of $t$$n$ distinct integers from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $t$$[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $t$$[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($t$$2$ appears twice in the array), and $t$$[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($t$$n=3$ but there is $t$$4$ in the array).

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing a single integer $n$$n$ ($n$$2 \le n \le 10^5$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $n$$10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case print $1$$n$ distinct integers $1$$a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}$ ($1$$1 \le a_i \le n$) — the permutation with the largest possible score.If there are several permutations with the maximum possible score, you can print any one of them.

## 说明

In the first test case, Alex wants to find a permutation of integers from 11$1$ to 55$5$. For the permutation a=[1,2,4,3,5]a=[1,2,4,3,5]$a=[1,2,4,3,5]$, the array dd$d$ is equal to [1,2,1,1,1][1,2,1,1,1]$[1,2,1,1,1]$. It contains 22$2$ distinct integers. It can be shown that there is no permutation of length 55$5$ with a higher score.In the second test case, Alex wants to find a permutation of integers from 11$1$ to 22$2$. There are only two such permutations: a=[1,2]a=[1,2]$a=[1,2]$ and a=[2,1]a=[2,1]$a=[2,1]$. In both cases, the array dd$d$ is equal to [1,1][1,1]$[1,1]$, so both permutations are correct.In the third test case, Alex wants to find a permutation of integers from 11$1$ to 77$7$. For the permutation a=[1,2,3,6,4,5,7]a=[1,2,3,6,4,5,7]$a=[1,2,3,6,4,5,7]$, the array dd$d$ is equal to [1,1,3,2,1,1,1][1,1,3,2,1,1,1]$[1,1,3,2,1,1,1]$. It contains 33$3$ distinct integers so its score is equal to 33$3$. It can be shown that there is no permutation of integers from 11$1$ to 77$7$ with a score higher than 33$3$.
