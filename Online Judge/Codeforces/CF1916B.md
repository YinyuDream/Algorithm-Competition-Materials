## 题目描述

A certain number $t$$1 \le x \le 10^9$ is chosen. You are given two integers $t$$a$ and $t$$b$, which are the two largest divisors of the number $t$$x$. At the same time, the condition $t$$1 \le a < b < x$ is satisfied.For the given numbers $t$$a$, $t$$b$, you need to find the value of $t$$x$.$t$$^{\dagger}$ The number $t$$y$ is a divisor of the number $t$$x$ if there is an integer $t$$k$ such that $t$$x = y \cdot k$.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $x$$t$ ($x$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The only line of each test cases contains two integers $x$$a$, $x$$b$ ($x$$1 \le a < b \le 10^9$).It is guaranteed that $x$$a$, $x$$b$ are the two largest divisors for some number $x$$1 \le x \le 10^9$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the number $6$$x$, such that $6$$a$ and $6$$b$ are the two largest divisors of the number $6$$x$.If there are several answers, print any of them.

## 说明

For the first test case, all divisors less than 66$6$ are equal to [1,2,3][1,2,3]$[1, 2, 3]$, among them the two largest will be 22$2$ and 33$3$.For the third test case, all divisors less than 3333$33$ are equal to [1,3,11][1,3,11]$[1, 3, 11]$, among them the two largest will be 33$3$ and 1111$11$.For the fifth test case, all divisors less than 2020$20$ are equal to [1,2,4,5,10][1,2,4,5,10]$[1, 2, 4, 5, 10]$, among them the two largest will be 55$5$ and 1010$10$.For the sixth test case, all divisors less than 1212$12$ are equal to [1,2,3,4,6][1,2,3,4,6]$[1, 2, 3, 4, 6]$, among them the two largest will be 44$4$ and 66$6$.
