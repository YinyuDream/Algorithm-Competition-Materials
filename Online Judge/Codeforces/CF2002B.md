## 题目描述

Alice got a permutation a1,a2,…,an$t$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of [1,2,…,n]$t$$[1,2,\ldots,n]$, and Bob got another permutation b1,b2,…,bn$t$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ of [1,2,…,n]$t$$[1,2,\ldots,n]$. They are going to play a game with these arrays.In each turn, the following events happen in order: Alice chooses either the first or the last element of her array and removes it from the array; Bob chooses either the first or the last element of his array and removes it from the array. The game continues for n−1$t$$n-1$ turns, after which both arrays will have exactly one remaining element: x$t$$x$ in the array a$t$$a$ and y$t$$y$ in the array b$t$$b$.If x=y$t$$x=y$, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Find which player will win if both players play optimally.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$\texttt{Alice}$$t$ (1≤t≤104$\texttt{Alice}$$1\le t\le10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$\texttt{Alice}$$n$ (1≤n≤3⋅105$\texttt{Alice}$$1\le n\le 3\cdot 10^5$).The next line contains n$\texttt{Alice}$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$\texttt{Alice}$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ (1≤ai≤n$\texttt{Alice}$$1\le a_i\le n$, all ai$\texttt{Alice}$$a_i$ are distinct) — the permutation of Alice.The next line contains n$\texttt{Alice}$$n$ integers b1,b2,…,bn$\texttt{Alice}$$b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$ (1≤bi≤n$\texttt{Alice}$$1\le b_i\le n$, all bi$\texttt{Alice}$$b_i$ are distinct) — the permutation of Bob.It is guaranteed that the sum of all n$\texttt{Alice}$$n$ does not exceed 3⋅105$\texttt{Alice}$$3\cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print Alice$3$$\texttt{Alice}$; otherwise, print Bob$3$$\texttt{Bob}$.

## 说明

In the first test case, Bob can win the game by deleting the same element as Alice did.In the second test case, Alice can delete 3$3$ in the first turn, and then in the second turn, delete the element that is different from the one Bob deleted in the first turn to win the game.
