## 题目描述

Today Hayato came home from school with homework.In the assignment, Hayato was given an array $t$$a$ of length $t$$n$. The task was to find $t$$3$ numbers in this array whose sum is odd. At school, he claimed that there are such $t$$3$ numbers, but Hayato was not sure, so he asked you for help.Answer if there are such three numbers, and if so, output indices $t$$i$, $t$$j$, and $t$$k$ such that $t$$a_i + a_j + a_k$ is odd.The odd numbers are integers that are not divisible by $t$$2$: $t$$1$, $t$$3$, $t$$5$, and so on.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $3$$t$ ($3$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.For each test case, the first line contains one integer $3$$n$ ($3$$3 \le n \le 300$) — the length of $3$$a$.The second line contains $3$$n$ integers $3$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($3$$1 \le a_i \le 10^5$) — the array $3$$a$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $3$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3$$2\cdot10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, in the first line print one word "YES" (without quotes) if there are $3$$3$ numbers with an odd sum or "NO" (without quotes) if there are no such $3$$3$ numbers.If the answer exists, then on the second line print $3$$3$ distinct integers $3$$i, j, k$ ($3$$1 \le i, j, k \le n$) — the indices of the numbers. If there are several answers, output any.

## 说明

In the first test case, there is one way to choose 33$3$ numbers, and since 1+1+1=31+1+1=3$1 + 1 + 1 = 3$, this triple is fine for us.In the second test case, you need to choose the numbers 1,2,21,2,2$1, 2, 2$, since 1+2+2=51+2+2=5$1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.In the third test case, there is one way to choose three numbers, but 1+2+3=61+2+3=6$1 + 2 + 3 = 6$ is an even number, so the required triple does not exist.In the fifth test case, no matter what three numbers we choose, their sum is even.
