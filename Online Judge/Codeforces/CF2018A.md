## 题目描述

DJ Genki vs Gram - Einherjar Joker⠀You have some cards. An integer between 1$t$$1$ and n$t$$n$ is written on each card: specifically, for each i$t$$i$ from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$, you have ai$t$$a_i$ cards which have the number i$t$$i$ written on them.There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k$t$$k$ coins, so you can buy at most k$t$$k$ new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between 1$t$$\mathbf{1}$ and n$t$$\mathbf{n}$, inclusive.After buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules: all the decks must have the same size; there are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck. Find the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$1$$t$ (1≤t≤104$1$$1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n$1$$n$, k$1$$k$ (1≤n≤2⋅105$1$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, 0≤k≤1016$1$$0 \leq k \leq 10^{16}$) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.The second line of each test case contains n$1$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$1$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ (0≤ai≤1010$1$$0 \leq a_i \leq 10^{10}$, ∑ai≥1$1$$\sum a_i \geq 1$) — the number of cards of type i$1$$i$ you have at the beginning, for each 1≤i≤n$1$$1 \leq i \leq n$.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$1$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$1$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible size of a deck if you operate optimally.

## 说明

In the first test case, you can buy one card with the number 1$1$, and your cards become [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]$[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]$. You can partition them into the decks [1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,3]$[1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 3]$: they all have size 2$2$, and they all contain distinct values. You can show that you cannot get a partition with decks of size greater than 2$2$, so the answer is 2$2$.In the second test case, you can buy two cards with the number 1$1$ and one card with the number 3$3$, and your cards become [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5]$[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]$, which can be partitioned into [1,2,3],[1,2,4],[1,2,5],[1,2,5],[2,3,5],[2,4,5]$[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 5], [1, 2, 5], [2, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5]$. You can show that you cannot get a partition with decks of size greater than 3$3$, so the answer is 3$3$.
