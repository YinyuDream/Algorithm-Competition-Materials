## 题目描述

MOOO! - Doja Cat⠀Farmer John has a permutation $t$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, where every integer from $t$$0$ to $t$$n-1$ occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array $t$$a$ of length $t$$n$ and challenges her to construct $t$$p$ based on $t$$a$. The array $t$$a$ is constructed so that $t$$a_i$ = $t$$\texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i$, where the $t$$\texttt{MEX}$ of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in that array. For example, $t$$\texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0$ and $t$$\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2$.Help Bessie construct any valid permutation $t$$p$ that satisfies $t$$a$. The input is given in such a way that at least one valid $t$$p$ exists. If there are multiple possible $t$$p$, it is enough to print one of them.

## 输入格式

The first line contains $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$$n$ ($n$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the lengths of $n$$p$ and $n$$a$.The second line of each test case contains $n$$n$ integers $n$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($n$$-n \leq a_i \leq n$) — the elements of array $n$$a$.It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid $n$$p$ for the given data.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $n$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output $p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]$$n$ integers on a new line, the elements of $p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]$$p$.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

## 样例

### 样例 1

**输入:**
```
351 1 -2 1 251 1 1 1 13-2 1 2
```

**输出:**
```
0 1 4 2 3 
0 1 2 3 4 
2 0 1
```

## 说明

In the first case, p=[0,1,4,2,3]$p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]$ is one possible output.a$a$ will then be calculated as a1=MEX(0)−0=1$a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1$, a2=MEX(0,1)−1=1$a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1$, a3=MEX(0,1,4)−4=−2$a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2$, a4=MEX(0,1,4,2)−2=1$a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1$, a5=MEX(0,1,4,2,3)−3=2$a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2$.So, as required, a$a$ will be [1,1,−2,1,2]$[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]$.
