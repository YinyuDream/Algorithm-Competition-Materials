## 题目描述

The two versions of the problem are different. You may want to read both versions. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.You are given an array a$t$$a$ of length n$t$$n$. Start with c=0$t$$c = 0$. Then, for each i$t$$i$ from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$ (in increasing order) do exactly one of the following: Option 1$t$$1$: set c$t$$c$ to c+ai$t$$c + a_i$. Option 2$t$$2$: set c$t$$c$ to |c+ai|$t$$|c + a_i|$, where |x|$t$$|x|$ is the absolute value of x$t$$x$. Let the maximum final value of c$t$$c$ after the procedure described above be equal to k$t$$k$. Find k$t$$k$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$k$$t$ (1≤t≤104$k$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$k$$n$ (2≤n≤2⋅105$k$$2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$).The second line of each case contains n$k$$n$ integers a1$k$$a_1$, a2$k$$a_2$, a3$k$$a_3$, …$k$$\ldots$, an$k$$a_n$ (−109≤ai≤109$k$$-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$).The sum of n$k$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105$k$$3 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the value of k$c$$k$.

## 说明

In the first test case, if we set c$c$ to its absolute value every time we add to it, we end up with 6$6$. It can be shown that this is the maximum result.In the second test case, taking the absolute value will never change anything, so we can just sum the array without doing anything to get 24$24$.In the third test case, it is optimal to wait until the end to set c$c$ to its absolute value, resulting in an answer of 6$6$.
