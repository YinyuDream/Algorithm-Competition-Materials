## 题目描述

A beautiful binary matrix is a matrix that has ones on its edges and zeros inside. Examples of four beautiful binary matrices. Today, Sakurako was playing with a beautiful binary matrix of size r×c$t$$r \times c$ and created a binary string s$t$$s$ by writing down all the rows of the matrix, starting from the first and ending with the r$t$$r$-th. More formally, the element from the matrix in the i$t$$i$-th row and j$t$$j$-th column corresponds to the ((i−1)∗c+j)$t$$((i-1)*c+j)$-th element of the string.You need to check whether the beautiful matrix from which the string s$t$$s$ was obtained could be squared. In other words, you need to check whether the string s$t$$s$ could have been build from a square beautiful binary matrix (i.e., one where r=c$t$$r=c$).

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$1$$t$ (1≤t≤104$1$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$1$$n$ (2≤n≤2⋅105$1$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the string.The second line of each test case contains the string s$1$$s$ of length n$1$$n$. The string is always the result of writing out the strings of a beautiful matrix.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$1$$n$ across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$1$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

Print "Yes", if the original matrix could have been square, and "No" otherwise.

## 说明

For the second test case, string 1111 can be obtained from the matrix: 1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$ For the third test case, string 111101111 can be obtained from the matrix: 1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$0$0$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$1$ There is no square matrix in the fourth case, such that the string can be obtained from it.
