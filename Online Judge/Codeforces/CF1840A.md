## 题目描述

There is a string $t$$a$ (unknown to you), consisting of lowercase Latin letters, encrypted according to the following rule into string $t$$s$: after each character of string $t$$a$, an arbitrary (possibly zero) number of any lowercase Latin letters, different from the character itself, is added; after each such addition, the character that we supplemented is added. You are given string $t$$s$, and you need to output the initial string $t$$a$. In other words, you need to decrypt string $t$$s$.Note that each string encrypted in this way is decrypted uniquely.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $a$$t$ ($a$$1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $a$$n$ ($a$$2 \le n \le 100$) — the length of the encrypted message.The second line of each test case contains a string $a$$s$ of length $a$$n$ — the encrypted message obtained from some string $a$$a$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the decrypted message $a$$a$ on a separate line.

## 说明

In the first encrypted message, the letter aa$a$ is encrypted as abaaba$aba$, and the letter cc$c$ is encrypted as cabaccabac$cabac$.In the second encrypted message, only one letter qq$q$ is encrypted as qzxcqqzxcq$qzxcq$.In the third encrypted message, zero characters are added to each letter.
