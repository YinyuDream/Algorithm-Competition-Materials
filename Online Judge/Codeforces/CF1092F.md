## 题目描述

You are given a tree consisting exactly of $n$$n$ vertices. Tree is a connected undirected graph with $n$$n-1$ edges. Each vertex $n$$v$ of this tree has a value $n$$a_v$ assigned to it.Let $n$$dist(x, y)$ be the distance between the vertices $n$$x$ and $n$$y$. The distance between the vertices is the number of edges on the simple path between them.Let's define the cost of the tree as the following value: firstly, let's fix some vertex of the tree. Let it be $n$$v$. Then the cost of the tree is $n$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} dist(i, v) \cdot a_i$.Your task is to calculate the maximum possible cost of the tree if you can choose $n$$v$ arbitrarily.

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer $v$$n$, the number of vertices in the tree ($v$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).The second line of the input contains $v$$n$ integers $v$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($v$$1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $v$$a_i$ is the value of the vertex $v$$i$.Each of the next $v$$n - 1$ lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge $v$$i$ is denoted by two integers $v$$u_i$ and $v$$v_i$, the labels of vertices it connects ($v$$1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $v$$u_i \ne v_i$).It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

## 输出格式

Print one integer — the maximum possible cost of the tree if you can choose any vertex as $3$$v$.

## 说明

Picture corresponding to the first example: You can choose the vertex 3$3$ as a root, then the answer will be 2⋅9+1⋅4+0⋅1+3⋅7+3⋅10+4⋅1+4⋅6+4⋅5=18+4+0+21+30+4+24+20=121$2 \cdot 9 + 1 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot 10 + 4 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 6 + 4 \cdot 5 = 18 + 4 + 0 + 21 + 30 + 4 + 24 + 20 = 121$.In the second example tree consists only of one vertex so the answer is always 0$0$.
