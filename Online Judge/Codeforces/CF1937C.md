## 题目描述

This is an interactive problem.There is a secret sequence $t$$p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}$, which is a permutation of $t$$\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$.You need to find any two indices $t$$i$ and $t$$j$ such that $t$$p_i \oplus p_j$ is maximized, where $t$$\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices $t$$a$, $t$$b$, $t$$c$, and $t$$d$ ($t$$0 \le a,b,c,d < n$). Next, the jury calculates $t$$x = (p_a \mid p_b)$ and $t$$y = (p_c \mid p_d)$, where $t$$|$ denotes the bitwise OR operation. Finally, you receive the result of comparison between $t$$x$ and $t$$y$. In other words, you are told if $t$$x < y$, $t$$x > y$, or $t$$x = y$.Please find any two indices $t$$i$ and $t$$j$ ($t$$0 \le i,j < n$) such that $t$$p_i \oplus p_j$ is maximum among all such pairs, using at most $t$$3n$ queries. If there are multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of them.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \le t \le 10^3$). The description of the test cases follows.

## 说明

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2]p=[0,3,1,2]$p=[0,3,1,2]$.For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p0∣p2)=(0∣1)=1<(p3∣p1)=(2∣3)=3(p0∣p2)=(0∣1)=1<(p3∣p1)=(2∣3)=3$(p_0 \mid p_2) = (0 \mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3$.For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p1∣p1)=(3∣3)=3=(p2∣p3)=(1∣2)=3(p1∣p1)=(3∣3)=3=(p2∣p3)=(1∣2)=3$(p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid 3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3$.For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p1∣p2)=(3∣1)=3>(p0∣p3)=(0∣2)=2(p1∣p2)=(3∣1)=3>(p0∣p3)=(0∣2)=2$(p_1 \mid p_2) = (3 \mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2$.The answer i=3i=3$i = 3$ and j=2j=2$j = 2$ is valid: (p3⊕p2)=(2⊕1)=3(p3⊕p2)=(2⊕1)=3$(p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3$ is indeed equal to the maximum possible value of pi⊕pjpi⊕pj$p_i \oplus p_j$. Another valid answer would be i=0i=0$i=0$ and j=1j=1$j=1$. As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=123n=12$3n=12$, the answer is considered correct.In the second test case, n=2n=2$n = 2$, so pp$p$ is either [0,1][0,1]$[0, 1]$ or [1,0][1,0]$[1, 0]$. In any case, p0⊕p1=1p0⊕p1=1$p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1$ is maximum possible.
