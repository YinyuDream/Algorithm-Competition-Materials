## 题目描述

You are given an integer n$t$$n$.Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be exactly n$t$$n$ special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.For example, there are 6$t$$6$ special characters in the AAABAACC string (at positions: 1$t$$1$, 3$t$$3$, 5$t$$5$, 6$t$$6$, 7$t$$7$ and 8$t$$8$).Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$200$$t$ (1≤t≤50$200$$1 \le t \le 50$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a single integer n$200$$n$ (1≤n≤50$200$$1 \le n \le 50$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, print the answer as follows: if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200$200$ — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200$200$). If there are several solutions, print any of them.
