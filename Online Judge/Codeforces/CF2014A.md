## 题目描述

There is a little bit of the outlaw in everyone, and a little bit of the hero too.The heroic outlaw Robin Hood is famous for taking from the rich and giving to the poor.Robin encounters n$t$$n$ people starting from the 1$t$$1$-st and ending with the n$t$$n$-th. The i$t$$i$-th person has ai$t$$a_i$ gold. If ai≥k$t$$a_i \ge k$, Robin will take all ai$t$$a_i$ gold, and if ai=0$t$$a_i=0$, Robin will give 1$t$$1$ gold if he has any. Robin starts with 0$t$$0$ gold.Find out how many people Robin gives gold to.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer t$2$$t$ (1≤t≤104$2$$1\leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers n$2$$n$, k$2$$k$ (1≤n≤50,1≤k≤100$2$$1 \le n \le 50, 1 \le k \le 100$) — the number of people and the threshold at which Robin Hood takes the gold.The second line of each test case contains n$2$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$2$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ (0≤ai≤100$2$$0 \le a_i \le 100$) — the gold of each person.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer, the number of people that will get gold from Robin Hood.

## 说明

In the first test case, Robin takes 22$2$ gold from the first person and gives a gold to the second person.In the second test case, Robin takes 33$3$ gold and gives 11$1$ gold to each of the next 22$2$ people.In the third test case, Robin takes 33$3$ gold and so only gives gold to 33$3$ other people.
