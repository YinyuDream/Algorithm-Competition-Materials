## 题目描述

It is known that Farmer John likes Permutations, but I like them too!— Sun Tzu, The Art of Constructing PermutationsYou are given a permutation∗$t$$^{\text{∗}}$ p$t$$p$ of length n$t$$n$.Find a permutation q$t$$q$ of length n$t$$n$ that minimizes the number of pairs (i,j$t$$i, j$) (1≤i≤j≤n$t$$1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$) such that pi+pi+1+…+pj=qi+qi+1+…+qj$t$$p_i + p_{i+1} + \ldots + p_j = q_i + q_{i+1} + \ldots + q_j$.∗$t$$^{\text{∗}}$A permutation of length n$t$$n$ is an array consisting of n$t$$n$ distinct integers from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$ in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]$t$$[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but [1,2,2]$t$$[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation (2$t$$2$ appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]$t$$[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation (n=3$t$$n=3$ but there is 4$t$$4$ in the array).

## 输入格式

The first line contains t$n$$t$ (1≤t≤104$n$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains n$n$$n$ (1≤n≤2⋅105$n$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$).The following line contains n$n$$n$ space-separated integers p1,p2,…,pn$n$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ (1≤pi≤n$n$$1 \leq p_i \leq n$) — denoting the permutation p$n$$p$ of length n$n$$n$.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$n$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing any permutation of length n$i, j$$n$ (the permutation q$i, j$$q$) such that q$i, j$$q$ minimizes the number of pairs.

## 说明

For the first test, there exists only one pair (i,j$i, j$) (1≤i≤j≤n$1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$) such that pi+pi+1+…+pj=qi+qi+1+…+qj$p_i + p_{i+1} + \ldots + p_j = q_i + q_{i+1} + \ldots + q_j$, which is (1,2$1, 2$). It can be proven that no such q$q$ exists for which there are no pairs.
