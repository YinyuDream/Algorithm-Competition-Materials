## 题目描述

You are given two integers $t$$n$ and $t$$k$ ($t$$k \le n$), where $t$$k$ is even.A permutation of length $t$$n$ is an array consisting of $t$$n$ distinct integers from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$ in any order. For example, $t$$[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $t$$[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation (as $t$$2$ appears twice in the array) and $t$$[0,1,2]$ is also not a permutation (as $t$$n=3$, but $t$$3$ is not present in the array).Your task is to construct a $t$$k$-level permutation of length $t$$n$.A permutation is called $t$$k$-level if, among all the sums of continuous segments of length $t$$k$ (of which there are exactly $t$$n - k + 1$), any two sums differ by no more than $t$$1$.More formally, to determine if the permutation $t$$p$ is $t$$k$-level, first construct an array $t$$s$ of length $t$$n - k + 1$, where $t$$s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j$, i.e., the $t$$i$-th element is equal to the sum of $t$$p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1}$.A permutation is called $t$$k$-level if $t$$\max(s) - \min(s) \le 1$.Find any $t$$k$-level permutation of length $t$$n$.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $k$$t$ ($k$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $k$$n$ and $k$$k$ ($k$$2 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $k$$k$ is even), where $k$$n$ is the length of the desired permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of $k$$n$ for all test cases does not exceed $k$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output any $p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4$$k$-level permutation of length $p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4$$n$.It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

## 说明

In the second test case of the example: p1+p2=3+1=4p1+p2=3+1=4$p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4$; p2+p3=1+2=3p2+p3=1+2=3$p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3$. The maximum among the sums is 44$4$, and the minimum is 33$3$.
