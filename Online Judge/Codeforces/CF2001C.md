## 题目描述

This is an interactive problem.Misuki has chosen a secret tree with n$t$$n$ nodes, indexed from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$, and asked you to guess it by using queries of the following type: "? a b" — Misuki will tell you which node x$t$$x$ minimizes |d(a,x)−d(b,x)|$t$$|d(a,x) - d(b,x)|$, where d(x,y)$t$$d(x,y)$ is the distance between nodes x$t$$x$ and y$t$$y$. If more than one such node exists, Misuki will tell you the one which minimizes d(a,x)$t$$d(a,x)$. Find out the structure of Misuki's secret tree using at most 15n$t$$15n$ queries!

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t$n$$t$ (1≤t≤200$n$$1 \le t \le 200$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of a single line with an integer n$n$$n$ (2≤n≤1000$n$$2 \le n \le 1000$), the number of nodes in the tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$n$$n$ across all test cases does not exceed 1000$n$$1000$.

## 说明

A tree is an undirected acyclic connected graph. A tree with n$n$ nodes will always have n−1$n-1$ edges.In the example case, the answer to "? 1 2" is 1$1$. This means that there is an edge between nodes 1$1$ and 2$2$.The answer to "? 1 3" is 1$1$. This means that there is an edge between nodes 1$1$ and 3$3$.The answer to "? 1 4" is 3$3$. It can be proven that this can only happen if node 3$3$ is connected to both node 1$1$ and 4$4$.The edges of the tree are hence (1,2)$(1,2)$, (1,3)$(1,3)$ and (3,4)$(3,4)$.
