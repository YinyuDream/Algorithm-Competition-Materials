## 题目描述

You are given two integers, $t$$n$ and $t$$k$. There is a graph on $t$$n$ vertices, numbered from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$, which initially has no edges.You have to assign each vertex an integer; let $t$$a_i$ be the integer on the vertex $t$$i$. All $t$$a_i$ should be distinct integers from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$.After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices $t$$(i, j)$, you add an edge between them if $t$$|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k$.Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum possible (for the given values of $t$$n$ and $t$$k$) number of cliques. Each vertex of the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques". So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \le t \le 1600$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $n$$n$ and $n$$k$ ($n$$2 \le n \le 40$; $n$$1 \le k \le 2n$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, print three lines: the first line should contain nn$n$ distinct integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤n1≤ai≤n$1 \le a_i \le n$) — the values you assign to the vertices; the second line should contain one integer qq$q$ (1≤q≤n1≤q≤n$1 \le q \le n$) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; the third line should contain nn$n$ integers c1,c2,…,cnc1,c2,…,cn$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ (1≤ci≤q1≤ci≤q$1 \le c_i \le q$) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices uu$u$ and vv$v$ are in the same clique if cu=cvcu=cv$c_u = c_v$. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
