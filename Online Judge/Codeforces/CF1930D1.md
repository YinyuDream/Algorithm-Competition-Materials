## 题目描述

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is the constraint on t$t$$t$ and n$t$$n$. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.For a binary†$t$$^\dagger$ pattern p$t$$p$ and a binary string q$t$$q$, both of length m$t$$m$, q$t$$q$ is called p$t$$p$-good if for every i$t$$i$ (1≤i≤m$t$$1 \leq i \leq m$), there exist indices l$t$$l$ and r$t$$r$ such that: 1≤l≤i≤r≤m$t$$1 \leq l \leq i \leq r \leq m$, and pi$t$$p_i$ is a mode‡$t$$^\ddagger$ of the string qlql+1…qr$t$$q_l q_{l+1} \ldots q_{r}$. For a pattern p$t$$p$, let f(p)$t$$f(p)$ be the minimum possible number of 1$t$$\mathtt{1}$s in a p$t$$p$-good binary string (of the same length as the pattern).You are given a binary string s$t$$s$ of size n$t$$n$. Find n∑i=1n∑j=if(sisi+1…sj).$t$ In other words, you need to sum the values of f$t$$f$ over all n(n+1)2$t$$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ substrings of s$t$$s$.†$t$$^\dagger$ A binary pattern is a string that only consists of characters 0$t$$\mathtt{0}$ and 1$t$$\mathtt{1}$.‡$t$$^\ddagger$ Character c$t$$c$ is a mode of string t$t$$t$ of length m$t$$m$ if the number of occurrences of c$t$$c$ in t$t$$t$ is at least ⌈m2⌉$t$$\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$. For example, 0$t$$\mathtt{0}$ is a mode of 010$t$$\mathtt{010}$, 1$t$$\mathtt{1}$ is not a mode of 010$t$$\mathtt{010}$, and both 0$t$$\mathtt{0}$ and 1$t$$\mathtt{1}$ are modes of 011010$t$$\mathtt{011010}$.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$f$$t$ (1≤t≤500$f$$1 \le t \le 500$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$f$$n$ (1≤n≤100$f$$1 \le n \le 100$) — the length of the binary string s$f$$s$.The second line of each test case contains a binary string s$f$$s$ of length n$f$$n$ consisting of only characters 0$f$$\mathtt{0}$ and 1$f$$\mathtt{1}$.It is guaranteed that the sum of n2$f$$n^2$ over all test cases does not exceed 104$f$$10^4$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the sum of values of f$\mathtt{1}$$f$ over all substrings of s$\mathtt{1}$$s$.

## 说明

In the first test case, the only 1$\mathtt{1}$-good string is 1$\mathtt{1}$. Thus, f(1)=1$f(\mathtt{1})=1$.In the second test case, f(10)=1$f(\mathtt{10})=1$ because 01$\mathtt{01}$ is 10$\mathtt{10}$-good, and 00$\mathtt{00}$ is not 10$\mathtt{10}$-good. Thus, the answer is f(1)+f(10)+f(0)=1+1+0=2$f(\mathtt{1})+f(\mathtt{10})+f(\mathtt{0}) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$.In the third test case, f$f$ equals to 0$0$ for all 1≤i≤j≤5$1 \leq i \leq j \leq 5$. Thus, the answer is 0$0$.
