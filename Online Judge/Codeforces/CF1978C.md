## 题目描述

Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation†$t$$^{\dagger}$ p$t$$p$ the value of the expression |p1−1|+|p2−2|+…+|pn−n|$t$$|p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n|$.For example, for the permutation [1,2,3]$t$$[1, 2, 3]$, the Manhattan value is |1−1|+|2−2|+|3−3|=0$t$$|1 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0$, and for the permutation [3,1,2]$t$$[3, 1, 2]$, the Manhattan value is |3−1|+|1−2|+|2−3|=2+1+1=4$t$$|3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4$.You are given integers n$t$$n$ and k$t$$k$. Find a permutation p$t$$p$ of length n$t$$n$ such that its Manhattan value is equal to k$t$$k$, or determine that no such permutation exists.†$t$$^{\dagger}$A permutation of length n$t$$n$ is an array consisting of n$t$$n$ distinct integers from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$ in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]$t$$[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but [1,2,2]$t$$[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation (2$t$$2$ appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]$t$$[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation (n=3$t$$n=3$ but there is 4$t$$4$ in the array).

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t$n$$t$ (1≤t≤104$n$$1 \leq t \leq 10^{4}$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers n$n$$n$ and k$n$$k$ (1≤n≤2⋅105,0≤k≤1012$n$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the length of the permutation and the required Manhattan value.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$n$$2 \cdot 10^{5}$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No". Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n$[3, 1, 2]$$n$ distinct integers p1,p2,…,pn$[3, 1, 2]$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ (1≤pi≤n$[3, 1, 2]$$1 \le p_i \le n$) — a suitable permutation.If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

## 说明

In the first test case, the permutation [3,1,2]$[3, 1, 2]$ is suitable, its Manhattan value is |3−1|+|1−2|+|2−3|=2+1+1=4$|3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4$.In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of length 4$4$ with a Manhattan value of 5$5$.In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]$[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]$ is suitable, its Manhattan value is |1−1|+|2−2|+|3−3|+|4−4|+|5−5|+|6−6|+|7−7|=0$|1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0$.
