## 题目描述

You are given two integers n$t$$n$ and k$t$$k$.In one operation, you can subtract any power of k$t$$k$ from n$t$$n$. Formally, in one operation, you can replace n$t$$n$ by (n−kx)$t$$(n-k^x)$ for any non-negative integer x$t$$x$.Find the minimum number of operations required to make n$t$$n$ equal to 0$t$$0$.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$n = 5$$t$ (1≤t≤104$n = 5$$1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers n$n = 5$$n$ and k$n = 5$$k$ (1≤n,k≤109$n = 5$$1 \le n, k \le 10^9$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the minimum number of operations on a new line.

## 说明

In the first test case, n=5n=5$n = 5$ and k=2k=2$k = 2$. We can perform the following sequence of operations: Subtract 20=120=1$2^0 = 1$ from 55$5$. The current value of nn$n$ becomes 5−1=45−1=4$5 - 1 = 4$. Subtract 22=422=4$2^2 = 4$ from 44$4$. The current value of nn$n$ becomes 4−4=04−4=0$4 - 4 = 0$. It can be shown that there is no way to make nn$n$ equal to 00$0$ in less than 22$2$ operations. Thus, 22$2$ is the answer.In the second test case, n=3n=3$n = 3$ and k=5k=5$k = 5$. We can perform the following sequence of operations: Subtract 50=150=1$5^0 = 1$ from 33$3$. The current value of nn$n$ becomes 3−1=23−1=2$3 - 1 = 2$. Subtract 50=150=1$5^0 = 1$ from 22$2$. The current value of nn$n$ becomes 2−1=12−1=1$2 - 1 = 1$. Subtract 50=150=1$5^0 = 1$ from 11$1$. The current value of nn$n$ becomes 1−1=01−1=0$1 - 1 = 0$. It can be shown that there is no way to make nn$n$ equal to 00$0$ in less than 33$3$ operations. Thus, 33$3$ is the answer.
