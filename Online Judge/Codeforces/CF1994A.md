## 题目描述

Petr, watching Sergey's stream, came up with a matrix $t$$a$, consisting of $t$$n$ rows and $t$$m$ columns (the number in the $t$$i$-th row and $t$$j$-th column is denoted as $t$$a_{i, j}$), which contains all integers from $t$$1$ to $t$$n \cdot m$. But he didn't like the arrangement of the numbers, and now he wants to come up with a new matrix $t$$b$, consisting of $t$$n$ rows and $t$$m$ columns, which will also contain all integers from $t$$1$ to $t$$n \cdot m$, such that for any $t$$1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq m$ it holds that $t$$a_{i, j} \ne b_{i, j}$.You are given the matrix $t$$a$, construct any matrix $t$$b$ that meets Petr's requirements, or determine that it is impossible.Hurry up! Otherwise, he will donate all his money to the stream in search of an answer to his question.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $n \cdot m$$t$ ($n \cdot m$$1 \leq t \leq 10^3$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $n \cdot m$$n$ and $n \cdot m$$m$ ($n \cdot m$$1 \leq n, m \leq 10$) — the number of rows and columns of matrix $n \cdot m$$a$.The next $n \cdot m$$n$ lines contain $n \cdot m$$m$ integers each, describing matrix $n \cdot m$$a$. The $n \cdot m$$i$-th of these lines contains the elements of matrix $n \cdot m$$a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \ldots, a_{i, m}$.It is guaranteed that all numbers in matrix $n \cdot m$$a$ are distinct and $n \cdot m$$1 \leq a_{i, j} \leq n \cdot m$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n \cdot m$$n \cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $n \cdot m$$5 \cdot 10^4$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output $b$$n \cdot m$ integers — any suitable matrix $b$$b$, or $b$$-1$ if such a matrix does not exist.

## 说明

In the first test case, there is only one element in the matrix, so matrix bb$b$ is the only matrix and it does not fit.In the second test case a1,1=2≠1=b1,1a1,1=2≠1=b1,1$a_{1, 1} = 2 \neq 1 = b_{1, 1}$, a2,1=1≠2=b2,1a2,1=1≠2=b2,1$a_{2, 1} = 1 \neq 2 = b_{2, 1}$.
