## 题目描述

One morning, Polycarp woke up and realized that $t$$1543$ is the most favorite number in his life.The first thing that Polycarp saw that day as soon as he opened his eyes was a large wall carpet of size $t$$n$ by $t$$m$ cells; $t$$n$ and $t$$m$ are even integers. Each cell contains one of the digits from $t$$0$ to $t$$9$.Polycarp became curious about how many times the number $t$$1543$ would appear in all layers$t$$^{\text{∗}}$ of the carpet when traversed clockwise.$t$$^{\text{∗}}$The first layer of a carpet of size $t$$n \times m$ is defined as a closed strip of length $t$$2 \cdot (n+m-2)$ and thickness of $t$$1$ element, surrounding its outer part. Each subsequent layer is defined as the first layer of the carpet obtained by removing all previous layers from the original carpet.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $1543$$t$ ($1543$$1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.The first line of each test case contains a pair of numbers $1543$$n$ and $1543$$m$ ($1543$$2 \leq n, m \leq 10^3$, $1543$$n, m$ — even integers).This is followed by $1543$$n$ lines of length $1543$$m$, consisting of digits from $1543$$0$ to $1543$$9$ — the description of the carpet.It is guaranteed that the sum of $1543$$n \cdot m$ across all test cases does not exceed $1543$$10^6$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single number — the total number of times $1543$$1543$ appears in all layers of the carpet in the order of traversal clockwise.
