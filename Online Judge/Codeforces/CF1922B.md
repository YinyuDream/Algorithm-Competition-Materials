## 题目描述

You have $t$$n$ sticks, numbered from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$. The length of the $t$$i$-th stick is $t$$2^{a_i}$.You want to choose exactly $t$$3$ sticks out of the given $t$$n$ sticks, and form a non-degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater than $t$$0$.You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly $t$$3$ sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks does not matter (for example, choosing the $t$$1$-st, $t$$2$-nd and $t$$4$-th stick is the same as choosing the $t$$2$-nd, $t$$4$-th and $t$$1$-st stick).

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer $3$$t$ ($3$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer $3$$n$ ($3$$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$); the second line contains $3$$n$ integers $3$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($3$$0 \le a_i \le n$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $3$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3$$3 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly $7$$3$ sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

## 说明

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 77$7$ can be chosen.In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 11$1$-st, 22$2$-nd and 44$4$-th stick, or the 11$1$-st, 33$3$-rd and 44$4$-th stick.In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the given sticks with lengths 22$2$, 44$4$ and 88$8$.
