## 题目描述

Given integers n$t$$n$ and k$t$$k$, construct a sequence of n$t$$n$ non-negative (i.e. ≥0$t$$\geq 0$) integers a1,a2,…,an$t$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ such that n∑i=1ai=k$t$$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k$ The number of 1$t$$1$s in the binary representation of a1|a2|…|an$t$$a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n$ is maximized, where |$t$$|$ denotes the bitwise OR operation.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$t$ (1≤t≤104$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers n$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$n$ and k$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$k$ (1≤n≤2⋅105$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, 1≤k≤109$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$1 \leq k \leq 10^9$) — the number of non-negative integers to be printed and the sum respectively.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a sequence a1,a2,…,an$5$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ on a new line that satisfies the conditions given above.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

## 说明

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can only output 5$5$ as the answer.In the second test case, we output 1,2$1, 2$ which sum up to 3$3$, and 1|2=(11)2$1 | 2 = (11)_2$ has two 1$1$s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.In the fourth test case, we output 3,1,1,32,2,12$3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12$ which sum up to 51$51$, and 3|1|1|32|2|12=(101111)2$3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2$ has five 1$1$s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.
