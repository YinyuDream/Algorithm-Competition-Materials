## 题目描述

Drink water.— Sun Tzu, The Art of Becoming a Healthy ProgrammerThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that x=n$t$$x=n$ in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.You are given two integers n$t$$n$ and x$t$$x$ (x=n$t$$x=n$). There are n$t$$n$ balls lined up in a row, numbered from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$ from left to right. Initially, there is a value ai$t$$a_i$ written on the i$t$$i$-th ball.For each integer i$t$$i$ from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$, we define a function f(i)$t$$f(i)$ as follows: Suppose you have a set S={1,2,…,i}$t$$S = \{1, 2, \ldots, i\}$. In each operation, you have to select an integer l$t$$l$ (1≤l<i$t$$1 \leq l < i$) from S$t$$S$ such that l$t$$l$ is not the largest element of S$t$$S$. Suppose r$t$$r$ is the smallest element in S$t$$S$ which is greater than l$t$$l$. If al>ar$t$$a_l > a_r$, you set al=al+ar$t$$a_l = a_l + a_r$ and remove r$t$$r$ from S$t$$S$. If al<ar$t$$a_l < a_r$, you set ar=al+ar$t$$a_r = a_l + a_r$ and remove l$t$$l$ from S$t$$S$. If al=ar$t$$a_l = a_r$, you choose either the integer l$t$$l$ or r$t$$r$ to remove from S$t$$S$: If you choose to remove l$t$$l$ from S$t$$S$, you set ar=al+ar$t$$a_r = a_l + a_r$ and remove l$t$$l$ from S$t$$S$. If you choose to remove r$t$$r$ from S$t$$S$, you set al=al+ar$t$$a_l = a_l + a_r$ and remove r$t$$r$ from S$t$$S$. f(i)$t$$f(i)$ denotes the number of integers j$t$$j$ (1≤j≤i$t$$1 \le j \le i$) such that it is possible to obtain S={j}$t$$S = \{j\}$ after performing the above operations exactly i−1$t$$i - 1$ times. For each integer i$t$$i$ from x$t$$x$ to n$t$$n$, you need to find f(i)$t$$f(i)$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains t$n-x+1$$t$ (1≤t≤104$n-x+1$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers n$n-x+1$$n$ and x$n-x+1$$x$ (1≤n≤2⋅105;x=n$n-x+1$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5; x = n$) — the number of balls and the smallest index i$n-x+1$$i$ for which you need to find f(i)$n-x+1$$f(i)$.The second line of each test case contains a1,a2,…,an$n-x+1$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤109$n-x+1$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the initial number written on each ball.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$n-x+1$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$n-x+1$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output n−x+1$f(5)$$n-x+1$ space separated integers on a new line, where the j$f(5)$$j$-th integer should represent f(x+j−1)$f(5)$$f(x+j-1)$.

## 说明

In the first test case, you are required to calculate f(5)$f(5)$. It can be shown that after 4$4$ operations, S$S$ can contain 2$2$, 3$3$, or 4$4$. The following shows the operations required to make S={4}$S = \{4\}$. Initially, S={1,2,3,4,5}$S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and a=[1,2,3,2,1]$a = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]$. Choose l=1$l = 1$. Naturally, r=2$r = 2$. Since a1<a2$a_1 < a_2$, we set a2=1+2$a_2 = 1 + 2$ and remove 1$1$ from S$S$. Now, S={2,3,4,5}$S = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and a=[1,3,3,2,1]$a = [1, 3, 3, 2, 1]$. Choose l=4$l = 4$. Naturally, r=5$r = 5$. Since a4>a5$a_4 > a_5$, we set a4=2+1$a_4 = 2 + 1$ and remove 5$5$ from S$S$. Now, S={2,3,4}$S = \{2, 3, 4\}$ and a=[1,3,3,3,1]$a = [1, 3, 3, 3, 1]$. Choose l=3$l = 3$. Naturally, r=4$r = 4$. Since a3=a4$a_3 = a_4$, we have a choice whether to remove 3$3$ or 4$4$. Since we want to preserve 4$4$, let's remove 3$3$. So, set a4=3+3$a_4 = 3 + 3$ and remove 3$3$ from S$S$. Now, S={2,4}$S = \{2, 4\}$ and a=[1,3,3,6,1]$a = [1, 3, 3, 6, 1]$. Choose l=2$l = 2$. Naturally, r=4$r = 4$. Since a2<a4$a_2 < a_4$, we set a4=3+6$a_4 = 3 + 6$ and remove 2$2$ from S$S$. Finally, S={4}$S = \{4\}$ and a=[1,3,3,9,1]$a = [1, 3, 3, 9, 1]$. In the second test case, you are required to calculate f(7)$f(7)$. It can be shown that after 6$6$ operations, S$S$ can contain 2$2$, 4$4$, 6$6$, or 7$7$.
