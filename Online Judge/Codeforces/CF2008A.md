## 题目描述

Today, Sakurako has a math exam. The teacher gave the array, consisting of a$t$$a$ ones and b$t$$b$ twos.In an array, Sakurako must place either a '+' or a '-' in front of each element so that the sum of all elements in the array equals 0$t$$0$.Sakurako is not sure if it is possible to solve this problem, so determine whether there is a way to assign signs such that the sum of all elements in the array equals 0$t$$0$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$0$$t$ (1≤t≤100$0$$1\le t\le 100$)  — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers a$0$$a$ and b$0$$b$ (0≤a,b<10$0$$0\le a,b<10$)  — the number of '1's and the number of '2's in the array.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output "Yes" if you can make the sum of the entire array equal to 0$a=0$$0$, and "No" otherwise.You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.

## 说明

a=0a=0$a=0$, b=1b=1$b=1$: This means the array is [2][2]$[2]$ — it is impossible to add the signs '+' or '-' to get 00$0$ as a result; a=0a=0$a=0$, b=3b=3$b=3$: This means the array is [2,2,2][2,2,2]$[2, 2, 2]$ — it is impossible to add the signs '+' or '-' to get 00$0$ as a result; a=2a=2$a=2$, b=0b=0$b=0$: This means the array is [1,1][1,1]$[1, 1]$ — it is possible to add the signs '+' or '-' to get 00$0$ as a result (+1−1=0+1−1=0$+1-1=0$); a=2a=2$a=2$, b=3b=3$b=3$: This means the array is [1,1,2,2,2][1,1,2,2,2]$[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]$ — it is possible to add the signs '+' or '-' to get 00$0$ as a result (+1+1−2−2+2=0+1+1−2−2+2=0$+1+1-2-2+2=0$);
