## 题目描述

A contest contains n$t$$n$ problems and the difficulty of the i$t$$i$-th problem is expected to be at most bi$t$$b_i$. There are already n$t$$n$ problem proposals and the difficulty of the i$t$$i$-th problem is ai$t$$a_i$. Initially, both a1,a2,…,an$t$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and b1,b2,…,bn$t$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ are sorted in non-decreasing order.Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w$t$$w$ is proposed, the most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w$t$$w$, insert it into the array a$t$$a$, sort array a$t$$a$ in non-decreasing order, and remove the last element from it.Find the minimum number of new problems to make ai≤bi$t$$a_i\le b_i$ for all i$t$$i$.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$w=800$$t$ (1≤t≤100$w=800$$1\le t\le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n$w=800$$n$ (1≤n≤100$w=800$$1 \leq n \leq 100$), representing the number of problems.The second line of each test case contains an array a$w=800$$a$ of length n$w=800$$n$ (1≤a1≤a2≤⋯≤an≤109$w=800$$1\le a_1\le a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9$).The third line of each test case contains an array b$w=800$$b$ of length n$w=800$$n$ (1≤b1≤b2≤⋯≤bn≤109$w=800$$1\le b_1\le b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

## 说明

In the first test case: Propose a problem with difficulty w=800$w=800$ and a$a$ becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]$[800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200]$. Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800$w=1800$ and a$a$ becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]$[800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000]$. It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new problems.In the second test case: Propose a problem with difficulty w=1$w=1$ and a$a$ becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8]$[1,4,5,6,7,8]$. Propose a problem with difficulty w=2$w=2$ and a$a$ becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7]$[1,2,4,5,6,7]$. Propose a problem with difficulty w=3$w=3$ and a$a$ becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6]$[1,2,3,4,5,6]$. It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new problems.
