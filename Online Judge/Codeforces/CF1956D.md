## 题目描述

Nene gave you an array of integers a1,a2,…,an$n$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of length n$n$$n$.You can perform the following operation no more than 5⋅105$n$$5\cdot 10^5$ times (possibly zero): Choose two integers l$n$$l$ and r$n$$r$ such that 1≤l≤r≤n$n$$1 \le l \le r \le n$, compute x$n$$x$ as MEX({al,al+1,…,ar})$n$$\operatorname{MEX}(\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\})$, and simultaneously set al:=x,al+1:=x,…,ar:=x$n$$a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x$. Here, MEX$n$$\operatorname{MEX}$ of a set of integers {c1,c2,…,ck}$n$$\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\}$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer m$n$$m$ which does not occur in the set c$n$$c$.Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a$n$$a$. Find the maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this sequence, you only should use no more than 5⋅105$n$$5\cdot 10^5$ operations in your solution.

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer n$s$$n$ (1≤n≤18$s$$1 \le n \le 18$) — the length of the array a$s$$a$.The second line contains n$s$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$s$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ (0≤ai≤107$s$$0\leq a_i \leq 10^7$) — the array a$s$$a$.

## 输出格式

In the first line, output two integers s$l=1$$s$ and m$l=1$$m$ (0≤m≤5⋅105$l=1$$0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5$) — the maximum sum of elements of the array a$l=1$$a$ and the number of operations in your solution.In the i$l=1$$i$-th of the following m$l=1$$m$ lines, output two integers l$l=1$$l$ and r$l=1$$r$ (1≤l≤r≤n$l=1$$1 \le l \le r \le n$), representing the parameters of the i$l=1$$i$-th operation.It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a$l=1$$a$ can always be obtained in no more than 5⋅105$l=1$$5 \cdot 10^5$ operations.

## 说明

In the first example, after the operation with l=1$l=1$ and r=2$r=2$ the array a$a$ becomes equal to [2,2]$[2,2]$. It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements of a$a$, so the answer is 4$4$.In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13$13$ which can be shown to be the largest.In the third example, the array a$a$ changes as follows: after the first operation (l=3$l=3$, r=3$r=3$), the array a$a$ becomes equal to [1,100,0,1]$[1,100,0,1]$; after the second operation (l=3$l=3$, r=4$r=4$), the array a$a$ becomes equal to [1,100,2,2]$[1,100,2,2]$. It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements of a$a$, so the answer is 105$105$.
