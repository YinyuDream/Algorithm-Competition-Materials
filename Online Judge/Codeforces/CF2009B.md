## 题目描述

You are playing your favorite rhythm game, osu!mania. The layout of your beatmap consists of n$t$$n$ rows and 4$t$$4$ columns. Because notes at the bottom are closer, you will process the bottommost row first and the topmost row last. Each row will contain exactly one note, represented as a '#'.For each note 1,2,…,n$t$$1, 2, \dots, n$, in the order of processing, output the column in which the note appears.

## 输入格式

The first line contains t$n$$t$ (1≤t≤100$n$$1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of test cases.For each test case, the first line contains n$n$$n$ (1≤n≤500$n$$1 \leq n \leq 500$) — the number of rows of the beatmap.The following n$n$$n$ lines contain 4$n$$4$ characters. The i$n$$i$-th line represents the i$n$$i$-th row of the beatmap from the top. It is guaranteed that the characters are either '.' or '#', and exactly one of the characters is '#'. It is guaranteed that the sum of n$n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 500$n$$500$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output n$n$ integers on a new line, the column that the i$i$-th note appears in for all i$i$ from 1$1$ to n$n$.
