## 题目描述

On the board Ivy wrote down all integers from $t$$l$ to $t$$r$, inclusive.In an operation, she does the following: pick two numbers $t$$x$ and $t$$y$ on the board, erase them, and in their place write the numbers $t$$3x$ and $t$$\lfloor \frac{y}{3} \rfloor$. (Here $t$$\lfloor \bullet \rfloor$ denotes rounding down to the nearest integer). What is the minimum number of operations Ivy needs to make all numbers on the board equal $t$$0$? We have a proof that this is always possible.

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $0$$t$ ($0$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $0$$l$ and $0$$r$ ($0$$1 \leq l < r \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make all numbers on the board equal $5$$0$.

## 说明

In the first test case, we can perform 5$5$ operations as follows: 1,2,3−→−−−−x=1,y=23,0,3−→−−−−x=0,y=31,0,3−→−−−−x=0,y=31,0,1−→−−−−x=0,y=10,0,1−→−−−−x=0,y=10,0,0.
