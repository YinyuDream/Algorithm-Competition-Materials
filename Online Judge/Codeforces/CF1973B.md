## 题目描述

Today, Cat and Fox found an array a$t$$a$ consisting of n$t$$n$ non-negative integers. Define the loneliness of a$t$$a$ as the smallest positive integer k$t$$k$ (1≤k≤n$t$$1 \le k \le n$) such that for any two positive integers i$t$$i$ and j$t$$j$ (1≤i,j≤n−k+1$t$$1 \leq i, j \leq n - k +1$), the following holds: ai|ai+1|…|ai+k−1=aj|aj+1|…|aj+k−1,$t$ where x|y$t$$x | y$ denotes the bitwise OR of x$t$$x$ and y$t$$y$. In other words, for every k$t$$k$ consecutive elements, their bitwise OR should be the same. Note that the loneliness of a$t$$a$ is well-defined, because for k=n$t$$k = n$ the condition is satisfied.Cat and Fox want to know how lonely the array a$t$$a$ is. Help them calculate the loneliness of the found array.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t$1$$t$ (1≤t≤104$1$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4 $) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains one integer n$1$$n$ (1≤n≤105$1$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) — the length of the array a$1$$a$.The second line of each test case contains n$1$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$1$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ (0≤ai<220$1$$0 \leq a_i < 2^{20}$) — the elements of the array.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$1$$n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed 105$1$$10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print one integer  — the loneliness of the given array.

## 说明

In the first example, the loneliness of an array with a single element is always 1$1$, so the answer is 1$1$. In the second example, the OR of each subarray of length k=1$k = 1$ is 2$2$, so the loneliness of the whole array is 1$1$.In the seventh example, it's true that (0|1|3)=(1|3|2)=(3|2|2)=(2|2|1)=(2|1|0)=(1|0|3)=3$(0 | 1 | 3) = (1 | 3 | 2) = (3 | 2 | 2) = (2 | 2 | 1) = (2 | 1 | 0) = (1 | 0 | 3) = 3$, so the condition is satisfied for k=3$k = 3$. We can verify that the condition is not true for any smaller k$k$, so the answer is indeed 3$3$.
