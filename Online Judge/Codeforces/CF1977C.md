## 题目描述

Nikita is a student passionate about number theory and algorithms. He faces an interesting problem related to an array of numbers.Suppose Nikita has an array of integers a$t$$a$ of length n$t$$n$. He will call a subsequence†$t$$^\dagger$ of the array special if its least common multiple (LCM) is not contained in a$t$$a$. The LCM of an empty subsequence is equal to 0$t$$0$.Nikita wonders: what is the length of the longest special subsequence of a$t$$a$? Help him answer this question!†$t$$^\dagger$ A sequence b$t$$b$ is a subsequence of a$t$$a$ if b$t$$b$ can be obtained from a$t$$a$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [5,2,3]$t$$[5,2,3]$ is a subsequence of [1,5,7,8,2,4,3]$t$$[1,5,7,8,2,4,3]$.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t$a$$t$ (1≤t≤2000$a$$1 \le t \le 2000$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$a$$n$ (1≤n≤2000$a$$1 \le n \le 2000$) — the length of the array a$a$$a$.The second line of each test case contains n$a$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$a$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤109$a$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the elements of the array a$a$$a$.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$a$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2000$a$$2000$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest special subsequence of a$a$$a$.

## 说明

In the first test case, the LCM of any non-empty subsequence is contained in aa$a$, so the answer is 00$0$.In the second test case, we can take the subsequence [3,2,10,1][3,2,10,1]$[3, 2, 10, 1]$, its LCM is equal to 3030$30$, which is not contained in aa$a$.In the third test case, we can take the subsequence [2,3,6,100003][2,3,6,100003]$[2, 3, 6, 100\,003]$, its LCM is equal to 600018600018$600\,018$, which is not contained in aa$a$.
