## 题目描述

Stack has an array $t$$a$ of length $t$$n$. He also has an empty set $t$$S$. Note that $t$$S$ is not a multiset.He will do the following three-step operation exactly $t$$n$ times: Select an index $t$$i$ such that $t$$1 \leq i \leq |a|$. Insert$t$$^\dagger$ $t$$a_i + i$ into $t$$S$. Delete $t$$a_i$ from $t$$a$. Note that the indices of all elements to the right of $t$$a_i$ will decrease by $t$$1$. Note that after $t$$n$ operations, $t$$a$ will be empty.Stack will now construct a new array $t$$b$ which is $t$$S$ sorted in decreasing order. Formally, $t$$b$ is an array of size $t$$|S|$ where $t$$b_i$ is the $t$$i$-th largest element of $t$$S$ for all $t$$1 \leq i \leq |S|$.Find the lexicographically largest$t$$^\ddagger$ $t$$b$ that Stack can make.$t$$^\dagger$ A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.$t$$^\ddagger$ An array $t$$p$ is lexicographically larger than a sequence $t$$q$ if and only if one of the following holds: $t$$q$ is a prefix of $t$$p$, but $t$$p \ne q$; or in the first position where $t$$p$ and $t$$q$ differ, the array $t$$p$ has a larger element than the corresponding element in $t$$q$. Note that $t$$[3,1,4,1,5]$ is lexicographically larger than $t$$[3,1,3]$, $t$$[\,]$, and $t$$[3,1,4,1]$ but not $t$$[3,1,4,1,5,9]$, $t$$[3,1,4,1,5]$, and $t$$[4]$.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $b$$t$ ($b$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $b$$n$ ($b$$1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of array $b$$a$.The second line of each test case contains $b$$n$ integers $b$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n}$ ($b$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the elements of array $b$$a$.The sum of $b$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $b$$3 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest $i=1$$b$.

## 说明

In the first test case, select i=1i=1$i=1$ in the first operation, insert a1+1=3a1+1=3$a_1 + 1 = 3$ in SS$S$, and delete a1a1$a_1$ from aa$a$. After the first operation, aa$a$ becomes a=[1]a=[1]$a=[1]$. In the second operation, we select i=1i=1$i=1$ again and insert a1+1=2a1+1=2$a_1 + 1 = 2$ in SS$S$. Thus S={2,3}S={2,3}$S=\{2, 3\}$, and b=[3,2]b=[3,2]$b = [3, 2]$.Note that if you select i=2i=2$i=2$ in the first operation, and i=1i=1$i=1$ in the second operation, S={3}S={3}$S=\{3\}$ as 33$3$ will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3]b=[3]$b=[3]$.As [3,2][3,2]$[3,2]$ is lexicographically larger than [3][3]$[3]$, we should select i=1i=1$i=1$ in the first operation.In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.
