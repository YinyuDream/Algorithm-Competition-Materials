## 题目描述

Recently, the first-year student Maxim learned about the Collatz conjecture, but he didn't pay much attention during the lecture, so he believes that the following process is mentioned in the conjecture:There is a variable x$t$$x$ and a constant y$t$$y$. The following operation is performed k$t$$k$ times: increase x$t$$x$ by 1$t$$1$, then while the number x$t$$x$ is divisible by y$t$$y$, divide it by y$t$$y$. Note that both of these actions are performed sequentially within one operation.For example, if the number x=16$t$$x = 16$, y=3$t$$y = 3$, and k=2$t$$k = 2$, then after one operation x$t$$x$ becomes 17$t$$17$, and after another operation x$t$$x$ becomes 2$t$$2$, because after adding one, x=18$t$$x = 18$ is divisible by 3$t$$3$ twice.Given the initial values of x$t$$x$, y$t$$y$, and k$t$$k$, Maxim wants to know what is the final value of x$t$$x$.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t$k$$t$ (1≤t≤104$k$$1 \le t \le 10^{4}$) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.The only line of each test case contains three integers x$k$$x$, y$k$$y$, and k$k$$k$ (1≤x,k≤109$k$$1 \le x, k \le 10^{9}$, 2≤y≤109$k$$2 \le y \le 10^{9}$) — the initial variable, constant and the number of operations.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the number obtained after applying k$x = 1$$k$ operations.

## 说明

In the first test case, there is only one operation applied to x=1x=1$x = 1$, resulting in xx$x$ becoming 22$2$.In the second test case, for x=2x=2$x = 2$, within one operation, one is added to xx$x$ and it's divided by y=3y=3$y = 3$, resulting in xx$x$ becoming 11$1$.In the third test case, xx$x$ changes as follows: After the first operation, x=1x=1$x = 1$, because 24+1=2524+1=25$24 + 1 = 25$ and 2525$25$ is divisible by y=5y=5$y = 5$ twice within one operation. After the second operation, x=2x=2$x = 2$. After the third operation, x=3x=3$x = 3$. After the fourth operation, x=4x=4$x = 4$. After the fifth operation, x=1x=1$x = 1$.
