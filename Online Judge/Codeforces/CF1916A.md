## 题目描述

In a sequence $t$$a$, whose product was equal to $t$$2023$, $t$$k$ numbers were removed, leaving a sequence $t$$b$ of length $t$$n$. Given the resulting sequence $t$$b$, find any suitable sequence $t$$a$ and output which $t$$k$ elements were removed from it, or state that such a sequence could not have existed.Notice that you are not guaranteed that such array exists.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer $a$$t$ ($a$$1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a description of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $a$$n$ ($a$$1 \le n, k \le 5$) — the size of sequence $a$$b$ and the number of numbers removed from sequence $a$$a$.The second line contains $a$$n$ integers $a$$b_1,b_2, \ldots,b_n$ ($a$$1 \leq b_i \leq 2023$) — the remaining sequence. The values of $a$$b_i$ might not be divisors of $a$$2023$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output "YES" if the sequence $289 \cdot 7 = 2023$$a$ exists, and in the following line output $289 \cdot 7 = 2023$$k$ non-negative integers that were removed from the sequence $289 \cdot 7 = 2023$$a$. If the sequence $289 \cdot 7 = 2023$$a$ does not exist, output "NO" in a single line.You can output the answer in any case (uppercase or lowercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

## 说明

In third test case product is equal to 289⋅7=2023289⋅7=2023$289 \cdot 7 = 2023$.In fourth test case product is already equal to 20232023$2023$.In seventh test case product is equal to 7⋅17⋅17=20237⋅17⋅17=2023$7 \cdot 17 \cdot 17 = 2023$.
