## 题目描述

Vlad found a strip of n$t$$n$ cells, numbered from left to right from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$. In the i$t$$i$-th cell, there is a positive integer ai$t$$a_i$ and a letter si$t$$s_i$, where all si$t$$s_i$ are either 'L' or 'R'.Vlad invites you to try to score the maximum possible points by performing any (possibly zero) number of operations.In one operation, you can choose two indices l$t$$l$ and r$t$$r$ (1≤l<r≤n$t$$1 \le l < r \le n$) such that sl$t$$s_l$ = 'L' and sr$t$$s_r$ = 'R' and do the following: add al+al+1+⋯+ar−1+ar$t$$a_l + a_{l + 1} + \dots + a_{r - 1} + a_r$ points to the current score; replace si$t$$s_i$ with '.' for all l≤i≤r$t$$l \le i \le r$, meaning you can no longer choose these indices. For example, consider the following strip: 3$t$$3$5$t$$5$1$t$$1$4$t$$4$3$t$$3$2$t$$2$LRLLLR You can first choose l=1$t$$l = 1$, r=2$t$$r = 2$ and add 3+5=8$t$$3 + 5 = 8$ to your score. 3$t$$3$5$t$$5$1$t$$1$4$t$$4$3$t$$3$2$t$$2$..LLLR Then choose l=3$t$$l = 3$, r=6$t$$r = 6$ and add 1+4+3+2=10$t$$1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 10$ to your score. 3$t$$3$5$t$$5$1$t$$1$4$t$$4$3$t$$3$2$t$$2$...... As a result, it is impossible to perform another operation, and the final score is 18$t$$18$.What is the maximum score that can be achieved?

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer tt$t$ (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer nn$n$ (2≤n≤2⋅1052≤n≤2⋅105$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the strip.The second line of each test case contains nn$n$ integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤1051≤ai≤105$1 \le a_i \le 10^5$) — the numbers written on the strip.The third line of each test case contains a string ss$s$ of nn$n$ characters 'L' and 'R'.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of nn$n$ across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output one integer — the maximum possible number of points that can be scored.
