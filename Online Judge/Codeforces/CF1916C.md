## 题目描述

Masha and Olya have an important team olympiad coming up soon. In honor of this, Masha, for warm-up, suggested playing a game with Olya:There is an array $t$$a$ of size $t$$n$. Masha goes first, and the players take turns. Each move is described by the following sequence of actions:$t$$\bullet$ If the size of the array is $t$$1$, the game ends.$t$$\bullet$ The player who is currently playing chooses two different indices $t$$i$, $t$$j$ ($t$$1 \le i, j \le |a|$), and performs the following operation — removes $t$$a_i$ and $t$$a_j$ from the array and adds to the array a number equal to $t$$\lfloor \frac{a_i + a_j}{2} \rfloor \cdot 2$. In other words, first divides the sum of the numbers $t$$a_i$, $t$$a_j$ by $t$$2$ rounding down, and then multiplies the result by $t$$2$.Masha aims to maximize the final number, while Olya aims to minimize it.Masha and Olya decided to play on each non-empty prefix of the initial array $t$$a$, and asked for your help.For each $t$$k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, answer the following question. Let only the first $t$$k$ elements of the array $t$$a$ be present in the game, with indices $t$$1, 2, \ldots, k$ respectively. What number will remain at the end with optimal play by both players?

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$$n$ ($n$$1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the size of the array.The second line contains $n$$n$ integers $n$$a_1,a_2, \ldots,a_n$ ($n$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the array on which Masha and Olya play.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $n$$10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output $1$$n$ integers. The $1$$k$-th of these numbers should be equal to the number that will remain at the end with optimal play by both players, on the array consisting of the first $1$$k$ elements of the array $1$$a$.

## 说明

In the third test case, for a prefix of length 11$1$, the answer is 33$3$. For a prefix of length 22$2$, Masha has only one move, so the answer is 1212$12$. For a prefix of length 33$3$, Masha has three possible moves: she chooses 33$3$ and 1010$10$, then the final number is 2222$22$, 33$3$ and 1111$11$, then the final number is 2424$24$, 1010$10$ and 1111$11$, then the final number is 2222$22$, so Masha will choose 33$3$ and 1111$11$ and get 2424$24$.
