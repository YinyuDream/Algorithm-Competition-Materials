## 题目描述

A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters '1' and '+' between the original characters of the sequence. For example: bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)"); bracket sequences ")(", "(" and ")" are not. Let's define the inverse of the bracket sequence as follows: replace all brackets '(' with ')', and vice versa (all brackets ')' with '('). For example, strings "()((" and ")())" are inverses of each other.You are given a regular bracket sequence s$t$$s$. Calculate the number of pairs of integers (l,r)$t$$(l,r)$ (1≤l≤r≤|s|$t$$1 \le l \le r \le |s|$) such that if you replace the substring of s$t$$s$ from the l$t$$l$-th character to the r$t$$r$-th character (inclusive) with its inverse, s$t$$s$ will still be a regular bracket sequence.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$(l,r)$$t$ (1≤t≤104$(l,r)$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains a non-empty regular bracket sequence; it consists only of characters '(' and/or ')'.Additional constraint on the input: the total length of the regular bracket sequences over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105$(l,r)$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print a single integer — the number of pairs (l,r)$(2, 3)$$(l,r)$ meeting the conditions from the statement.

## 说明

In the first example, there is only one pair: (2,3)$(2, 3)$: (()) →$\rightarrow$ ()(). In the second example, there are no pairs.In the third example, there are three pairs: (2,3)$(2, 3)$: ()()() →$\rightarrow$ (())(); (4,5)$(4, 5)$: ()()() →$\rightarrow$ ()(()); (2,5)$(2, 5)$: ()()() →$\rightarrow$ (()());
