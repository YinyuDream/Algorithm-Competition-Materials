## 题目描述

Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, 378QAQ gave her an array a$t$$a$ consisting of n$t$$n$ positive integers as a gift.Mocha thinks that a$t$$a$ is beautiful if there exist two numbers i$t$$i$ and j$t$$j$ (1≤i,j≤n$t$$1\leq i,j\leq n$, i≠j$t$$i\neq j$) such that for all k$t$$k$ (1≤k≤n$t$$1 \leq k \leq n$), ak$t$$a_k$ is divisible†$t$$^\dagger$ by either ai$t$$a_i$ or aj$t$$a_j$.Determine whether a$t$$a$ is beautiful.†$t$$^\dagger$ x$t$$x$ is divisible by y$t$$y$ if there exists an integer z$t$$z$ such that x=y⋅z$t$$x = y \cdot z$.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$a$$t$ (1≤t≤500$a$$1\leq t\leq 500$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$a$$n$ (3≤n≤105$a$$3\leq n\leq 10^5$) — the length of the array a$a$$a$.The second line of each test case contains n$a$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$a$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ (1≤ai≤109$a$$1\leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the elements of the array a$a$$a$.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$a$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 105$a$$10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output "Yes" if array a$i=2$$a$ is beautiful, and output "No" otherwise.You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

## 说明

In the first test case, any two numbers in the array are coprime, so the answer is "No".In the second test case, we can pick i=2$i=2$ and j=1$j=1$. Since every number in the array is divisible by ai=1$a_i = 1$, the answer is "Yes".In the third test case, we can pick i=3$i=3$ and j=5$j=5$. 2$2$ and 4$4$ is divisible by ai=2$a_i = 2$ while 3$3$, 6$6$ and 12$12$ is divisible by aj=3$a_j = 3$, so the answer is "Yes".
