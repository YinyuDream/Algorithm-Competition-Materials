## 题目描述

Kristina has an array $t$$a$, called a template, consisting of $t$$n$ integers. She also has $t$$m$ strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The strings are numbered from $t$$1$ to $t$$m$. She wants to check which strings match the template.A string $t$$s$ is considered to match the template if all of the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied: The length of the string $t$$s$ is equal to the number of elements in the array $t$$a$. The same numbers from $t$$a$ correspond to the same symbols from $t$$s$. So, if $t$$a_i = a_j$, then $t$$s_i = s_j$ for ($t$$1 \le i, j \le n$). The same symbols from $t$$s$ correspond to the same numbers from $t$$a$. So, if $t$$s_i = s_j$, then $t$$a_i = a_j$ for ($t$$1 \le i, j \le n$). In other words, there must be a one-to-one correspondence between the characters of the string and the elements of the array.For example, if $t$$a$ = [$t$$3, 5, 2, 1, 3$], then the string "abfda" matches the template, while the string "afbfa" does not, since the character "f" corresponds to both numbers $t$$1$ and $t$$5$.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer $m$$t$ ($m$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The following descriptions are for the test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $m$$n$ ($m$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in the array $m$$a$.The second line of each test case contains exactly $m$$n$ integers $m$$a_i$ ($m$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the elements of the array $m$$a$.The third line of each test case contains a single integer $m$$m$ ($m$$1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of strings to check for template matching.Following are $m$$m$ strings, each containing a non-empty string $m$$s_j$ ($m$$1 \le |s_j| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of $m$$n$ across all test cases does not exceed $m$$2 \cdot 10^5$, and that the sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed $m$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output mm$m$ lines. On the ii$i$-th line (1≤i≤m1≤i≤m$1 \le i \le m$) output: "YES", if the string with index ii$i$ matches the template; "NO" otherwise. You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
