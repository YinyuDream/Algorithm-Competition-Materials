## 题目描述

t+pazolite, ginkiha, Hommarju - Paved Garden⠀You are given a tree with $t$$n$ nodes, rooted at node $t$$1$. In this problem, a leaf is a non-root node with degree $t$$1$.In one operation, you can remove a leaf and the edge adjacent to it (possibly, new leaves appear). What is the minimum number of operations that you have to perform to get a tree, also rooted at node $t$$1$, where all the leaves are at the same distance from the root?

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $(1, 3)$$t$ ($(1, 3)$$1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $(1, 3)$$n$ ($(1, 3)$$3 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of nodes.Each of the next $(1, 3)$$n-1$ lines contains two integers $(1, 3)$$u$, $(1, 3)$$v$ ($(1, 3)$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$, $(1, 3)$$u \neq v$), describing an edge that connects $(1, 3)$$u$ and $(1, 3)$$v$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $(1, 3)$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $(1, 3)$$5 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer: the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.

## 说明

In the first two examples, the tree is as follows: In the first example, by removing edges (1,3)(1,3)$(1, 3)$ and (2,5)(2,5)$(2, 5)$, the resulting tree has all leaves (nodes 66$6$ and 77$7$) at the same distance from the root (node 11$1$), which is 33$3$. The answer is 22$2$, as it is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to achieve the goal.In the second example, removing edges (1,4)(1,4)$(1, 4)$ and (5,7)(5,7)$(5, 7)$ results in a tree where all leaves (nodes 44$4$ and 55$5$) are at the same distance from the root (node 11$1$), which is 22$2$.
