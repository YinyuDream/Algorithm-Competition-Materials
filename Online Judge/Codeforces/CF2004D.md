## 题目描述

There are n$t$$n$ cities located on a straight line. The cities are numbered from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$.Portals are used to move between cities. There are 4$t$$4$ colors of portals: blue, green, red, and yellow. Each city has portals of two different colors. You can move from city i$t$$i$ to city j$t$$j$ if they have portals of the same color (for example, you can move between a "blue-red" city and a "blue-green" city). This movement costs |i−j|$t$$|i-j|$ coins.Your task is to answer q$t$$q$ independent queries: calculate the minimum cost to move from city x$t$$x$ to city y$t$$y$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$x$$t$ (1≤t≤104$x$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers n$x$$n$ and q$x$$q$ (1≤n,q≤2⋅105$x$$1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of cities and the number of queries, respectively.The second line contains n$x$$n$ strings of the following types: BG, BR, BY, GR, GY, or RY; the i$x$$i$-th of them describes the portals located in the i$x$$i$-th city; the symbol B indicates that there is a blue portal in the city, G — green, R — red, and Y — yellow.The j$x$$j$-th of the next q$x$$q$ lines contains two integers xj$x$$x_j$ and yj$x$$y_j$ (1≤xj,yj≤n$x$$1 \le x_j, y_j \le n$) — the description of the j$x$$j$-th query.Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n$x$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$x$$2 \cdot 10^5$; the sum of q$x$$q$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$x$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each query, print a single integer — the minimum cost to move from city x$x$ to city y$y$ (or −1$-1$ if it is impossible).
