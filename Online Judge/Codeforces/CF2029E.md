## 题目描述

For two integers x$t$$x$ and y$t$$y$ (x,y≥2$t$$x,y\ge 2$), we will say that x$t$$x$ is a generator of y$t$$y$ if and only if x$t$$x$ can be transformed to y$t$$y$ by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero): Choose a divisor d$t$$d$ (d≥2$t$$d\ge 2$) of x$t$$x$, then increase x$t$$x$ by d$t$$d$. For example, 3$t$$3$ is a generator of 8$t$$8$ since we can perform the following operations: 3d=3→6d=2→8$t$$3 \xrightarrow{d = 3} 6 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 8$; 4$t$$4$ is a generator of 10$t$$10$ since we can perform the following operations: 4d=4→8d=2→10$t$$4 \xrightarrow{d = 4} 8 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 10$; 5$t$$5$ is not a generator of 6$t$$6$ since we cannot transform 5$t$$5$ into 6$t$$6$ with the operation above. Now, Kevin gives you an array a$t$$a$ consisting of n$t$$n$ pairwise distinct integers (ai≥2$t$$a_i\ge 2$).You have to find an integer x≥2$t$$x\ge 2$ such that for each 1≤i≤n$t$$1\le i\le n$, x$t$$x$ is a generator of ai$t$$a_i$, or determine that such an integer does not exist.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t$x$$t$ (1≤t≤104$x$$1\le t\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$x$$n$ (1≤n≤105$x$$1\le n\le 10^5$) — the length of the array a$x$$a$.The second line contains n$x$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$x$$a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ (2≤ai≤4⋅105$x$$2\le a_i\le 4\cdot 10^5$) — the elements in the array a$x$$a$. It is guaranteed that the elements are pairwise distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$x$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 105$x$$10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer x$x=2$$x$ — the integer you found. Print −1$x=2$$-1$ if there does not exist a valid x$x=2$$x$.If there are multiple answers, you may output any of them.

## 说明

In the first test case, for x=2$x=2$: 2$2$ is a generator of 8$8$, since we can perform the following operations: 2d=2→4d=4→8$2 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 4 \xrightarrow{d = 4} 8$; 2$2$ is a generator of 9$9$, since we can perform the following operations: 2d=2→4d=2→6d=3→9$2 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 4 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 6 \xrightarrow{d = 3} 9$. 2$2$ is a generator of 10$10$, since we can perform the following operations: 2d=2→4d=2→6d=2→8d=2→10$2 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 4 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 6 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 8 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 10$. In the second test case, it can be proven that it is impossible to find a common generator of the four integers.
