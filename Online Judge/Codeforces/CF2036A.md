## 题目描述

Boris Notkin composes melodies. He represents them as a sequence of notes, where each note is encoded as an integer from 0$t$$0$ to 127$t$$127$ inclusive. The interval between two notes a$t$$a$ and b$t$$b$ is equal to |a−b|$t$$|a - b|$ semitones.Boris considers a melody perfect if the interval between each two adjacent notes is either 5$t$$5$ semitones or 7$t$$7$ semitones.After composing his latest melodies, he enthusiastically shows you his collection of works. Help Boris Notkin understand whether his melodies are perfect.

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer t$t$ (1≤t≤1000$1 \leq t \leq 1000$) — the number of melodies.Each melody is described by two lines. The first line contains an integer n$n$ (2≤n≤50$2 \leq n \leq 50$) — the number of notes in the melody.The second line contains n$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n}$ (0≤ai≤127$0 \leq a_{i} \leq 127$) — the notes of the melody.

## 输出格式

For each melody, output "YES", if it is perfect; otherwise, output "NO".You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
