## 题目描述

Two players, Alice and Bob, are playing a game. They have n$t$$n$ piles of stones, with the i$t$$i$-th pile initially containing ai$t$$a_i$ stones.On their turn, a player can choose any pile of stones and take any positive number of stones from it, with one condition: let the current number of stones in the pile be x$t$$x$. It is not allowed to take from the pile a number of stones y$t$$y$ such that the greatest common divisor of x$t$$x$ and y$t$$y$ is not equal to 1$t$$1$. The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally (that is, if a player has a strategy that allows them to win, no matter how the opponent responds, they will win). Alice goes first.Determine who will win.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$t$ (1≤t≤104$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n$n$ (1≤n≤3⋅105$1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$); the second line contains n$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤107$1 \le a_i \le 10^7$). Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n$n$ across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105$3 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output Alice if Alice wins, or Bob if Bob wins.
