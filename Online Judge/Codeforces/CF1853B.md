## 题目描述

Ntarsis has received two integers $t$$n$ and $t$$k$ for his birthday. He wonders how many fibonacci-like sequences of length $t$$k$ can be formed with $t$$n$ as the $t$$k$-th element of the sequence. A sequence of non-decreasing non-negative integers is considered fibonacci-like if $t$$f_i = f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}$ for all $t$$i > 2$, where $t$$f_i$ denotes the $t$$i$-th element in the sequence. Note that $t$$f_1$ and $t$$f_2$ can be arbitrary.For example, sequences such as $t$$[4,5,9,14]$ and $t$$[0,1,1]$ are considered fibonacci-like sequences, while $t$$[0,0,0,1,1]$, $t$$[1, 2, 1, 3]$, and $t$$[-1,-1,-2]$ are not: the first two do not always satisfy $t$$f_i = f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}$, the latter does not satisfy that the elements are non-negative.Impress Ntarsis by helping him with this task.

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $k$$t$ ($k$$1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$), the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.Each test case contains two integers, $k$$n$ and $k$$k$ ($k$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $k$$3 \leq k \leq 10^9$).It is guaranteed the sum of $k$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $k$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case output an integer, the number of fibonacci-like sequences of length $4$$k$ such that the $4$$k$-th element in the sequence is $4$$n$. That is, output the number of sequences $4$$f$ of length $4$$k$ so $4$$f$ is a fibonacci-like sequence and $4$$f_k = n$. It can be shown this number is finite.

## 说明

There are 44$4$ valid fibonacci-like sequences for n=22n=22$n = 22$, k=4k=4$k = 4$: [6,8,14,22][6,8,14,22]$[6,8,14,22]$, [4,9,13,22][4,9,13,22]$[4,9,13,22]$, [2,10,12,22][2,10,12,22]$[2,10,12,22]$, [0,11,11,22][0,11,11,22]$[0,11,11,22]$. For n=3n=3$n = 3$, k=9k=9$k = 9$, it can be shown that there are no fibonacci-like sequences satisfying the given conditions.For n=55n=55$n = 55$, k=11k=11$k = 11$, [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55][0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]$[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]$ is the only fibonacci-like sequence.
