## 题目描述

A robot is placed in a cell $t$$(0, 0)$ of an infinite grid. This robot has adjustable length legs. Initially, its legs have length $t$$1$.Let the robot currently be in the cell $t$$(x, y)$ and have legs of length $t$$m$. In one move, it can perform one of the following three actions: jump into the cell $t$$(x + m, y)$; jump into the cell $t$$(x, y + m)$; increase the length of the legs by $t$$1$, i. e. set it to $t$$m + 1$. What's the smallest number of moves robot has to make to reach a cell $t$$(a, b)$?

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $(a, b)$$t$ ($(a, b)$$1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $(a, b)$$a$ and $(a, b)$$b$ ($(a, b)$$1 \le a, b \le 10^9$) — the ending cell.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print a single integer — the smallest number of moves the robot is required to make to reach a cell $(0, 1)$$(a, b)$ from a cell $(0, 1)$$(0, 0)$.

## 说明

In the first testcase, the robot can first jump to (0,1)(0,1)$(0, 1)$, then to (1,1)(1,1)$(1, 1)$. If it ever increases the length of its legs, it will only be able to jump past (1,1)(1,1)$(1, 1)$.In the second testcase, the robot can jump to (1,0)(1,0)$(1, 0)$, then increase the length of its length to 22$2$ and jump three times to reach (1,6)(1,6)$(1, 6)$.In the third testcase, the robot can increase the length of its legs three times to make it 44$4$. Then jump to (0,4)(0,4)$(0, 4)$. Then jump twice to reach (8,4)(8,4)$(8, 4)$.
