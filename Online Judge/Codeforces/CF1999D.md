## 题目描述

Slavic has a very tough exam and needs your help in order to pass it. Here is the question he is struggling with:There exists a string s$T$$s$, which consists of lowercase English letters and possibly zero or more "?". Slavic is asked to change each "?" to a lowercase English letter such that string t$T$$t$ becomes a subsequence (not necessarily continuous) of the string s$T$$s$. Output any such string, or say that it is impossible in case no string that respects the conditions exists.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer T$T$ (1≤T≤104$1 \leq T \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single string s$s$ (1≤|s|≤2⋅105$1 \leq |s| \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, and s$s$ consists only of lowercase English letters and "?"-s)  – the original string you have.The second line of each test case contains a single string t$t$ (1≤|t|≤|s|$1 \leq |t| \leq |s|$, and t$t$ consists only of lowercase English letters)  – the string that should be a subsequence of string s$s$.The sum of |s|$|s|$ over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105$2 \cdot 10^5$, where |x|$|x|$ denotes the length of the string x$x$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, if no such string exists as described in the statement, output "NO" (without quotes).Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string that respects all conditions.You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.
