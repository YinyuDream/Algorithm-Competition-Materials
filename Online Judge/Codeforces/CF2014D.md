## 题目描述

Impress thy brother, yet fret not thy mother.Robin's brother and mother are visiting, and Robin gets to choose the start day for each visitor.All days are numbered from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$. Visitors stay for d$t$$d$ continuous days, all of those d$t$$d$ days must be between day 1$t$$1$ and n$t$$n$ inclusive.Robin has a total of k$t$$k$ risky 'jobs' planned. The i$t$$i$-th job takes place between days li$t$$l_i$ and ri$t$$r_i$ inclusive, for 1≤i≤k$t$$1 \le i \le k$. If a job takes place on any of the d$t$$d$ days, the visit overlaps with this job (the length of overlap is unimportant).Robin wants his brother's visit to overlap with the maximum number of distinct jobs, and his mother's the minimum.Find suitable start days for the visits of Robin's brother and mother. If there are multiple suitable days, choose the earliest one.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer t$1$$t$ (1≤t≤104$1$$1\leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case consists of three integers n$1$$n$, d$1$$d$, k$1$$k$ (1≤n≤105,1≤d,k≤n$1$$1 \le n \le 10^5, 1 \le d, k \le n$) — the number of total days, duration of the visits, and the number of jobs. Then follow k$1$$k$ lines of each test case, each with two integers li$1$$l_i$ and ri$1$$r_i$ (1≤li≤ri≤n$1$$1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) — the start and end day of each job.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$1$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$1$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output two integers, the best starting days of Robin's brother and mother respectively. Both visits must fit between day 1$2$$1$ and n$2$$n$ inclusive.

## 说明

In the first test case, the only job fills all 22$2$ days, both should visit on day 11$1$.In the second test case, day 22$2$ overlaps with 22$2$ jobs and day 11$1$ overlaps with only 11$1$.In the third test case, Robert visits for days [1,2][1,2]$[1,2]$, Mrs. Hood visits for days [4,5][4,5]$[4,5]$.
