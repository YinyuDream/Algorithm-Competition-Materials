## 题目描述

You are given an integer array a$t$$a$ of length n$t$$n$.You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): take any element of the array a$t$$a$, which is at least 10$t$$10$, delete it, and instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in order they appear in that element.For example: if we apply this operation to the 3$t$$3$-rd element of the array [12,3,45,67]$t$$[12, 3, 45, 67]$, then the array becomes [12,3,4,5,67]$t$$[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]$. if we apply this operation to the 2$t$$2$-nd element of the array [2,10]$t$$[2, 10]$, then the array becomes [2,1,0]$t$$[2, 1, 0]$. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a$t$$a$ sorted in non-descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to transform the array a$t$$a$ in such a way that a1≤a2≤⋯≤ak$t$$a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k$, where k$t$$k$ is the current length of the array a$t$$a$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer t$a$$t$ (1≤t≤103$a$$1 \le t \le 10^3$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n$a$$n$ (2≤n≤50$a$$2 \le n \le 50$). the second line contains n$a$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$a$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ (0≤ai≤99$a$$0 \le a_i \le 99$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a$[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]$$a$ sorted in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be recognized as a positive answer.

## 说明

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes [1,2,3,45,67]$[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]$.In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.In the third example, the array is already sorted.
