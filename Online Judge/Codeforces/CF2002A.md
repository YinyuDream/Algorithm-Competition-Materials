## 题目描述

You received an n×m$n\times m$ grid from a mysterious source. The source also gave you a magic positive integer constant k$k$.The source told you to color the grid with some colors, satisfying the following condition: If (x1,y1)$(x_1,y_1)$, (x2,y2)$(x_2,y_2)$ are two distinct cells with the same color, then max(|x1−x2|,|y1−y2|)≥k$\max(|x_1-x_2|,|y_1-y_2|)\ge k$. You don't like using too many colors. Please find the minimum number of colors needed to color the grid.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$t$ (1≤t≤1000$1\le t\le1000$). The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case consists of three positive integers n$n$, m$m$, k$k$ (1≤n,m,k≤104$1\le n,m,k\le10^4$) — the dimensions of the grid and the magic constant.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of colors needed to color the grid.

## 说明

In the first test case, one of the optimal constructions is: In the second test case, the color of all cells must be pairwise different, so the answer is 5$5$.
