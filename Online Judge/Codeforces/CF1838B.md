## 题目描述

You are given a permutation $t$$p$ of size $t$$n$. You want to minimize the number of subarrays of $t$$p$ that are permutations. In order to do so, you must perform the following operation exactly once: Select integers $t$$i$, $t$$j$, where $t$$1 \le i, j \le n$, then Swap $t$$p_i$ and $t$$p_j$. For example, if $t$$p = [5, 1, 4, 2, 3]$ and we choose $t$$i = 2$, $t$$j = 3$, the resulting array will be $t$$[5, 4, 1, 2, 3]$. If instead we choose $t$$i = j = 5$, the resulting array will be $t$$[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]$.Which choice of $t$$i$ and $t$$j$ will minimize the number of subarrays that are permutations?A permutation of length $t$$n$ is an array consisting of $t$$n$ distinct integers from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $t$$[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $t$$[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($t$$2$ appears twice in the array), and $t$$[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($t$$n=3$ but there is $t$$4$ in the array).An array $t$$a$ is a subarray of an array $t$$b$ if $t$$a$ can be obtained from $t$$b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $i$$t$ ($i$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $i$$n$ ($i$$3 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$) — the size of the permutation.The next line of each test case contains $i$$n$ integers $i$$p_1, p_2, \ldots p_n$ ($i$$1 \le p_i \le n$, all $i$$p_i$ are distinct) — the elements of the permutation $i$$p$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $i$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $i$$2\cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output two integers $p_1$$i$ and $p_1$$j$ ($p_1$$1 \le i, j \le n$)  — the indices to swap in $p_1$$p$.If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

## 说明

For the first test case, there are four possible arrays after the swap: If we swap p1p1$p_1$ and p2p2$p_2$, we get the array [2,1,3][2,1,3]$[2, 1, 3]$, which has 3 subarrays that are permutations ([1][1]$[1]$, [2,1][2,1]$[2, 1]$, [2,1,3][2,1,3]$[2, 1, 3]$). If we swap p1p1$p_1$ and p3p3$p_3$, we get the array [3,2,1][3,2,1]$[3, 2, 1]$, which has 3 subarrays that are permutations ([1][1]$[1]$, [2,1][2,1]$[2, 1]$, [3,2,1][3,2,1]$[3, 2, 1]$). If we swap p2p2$p_2$ and p3p3$p_3$, we get the array [1,3,2][1,3,2]$[1, 3, 2]$, which has 2 subarrays that are permutations ([1][1]$[1]$, [1,3,2][1,3,2]$[1, 3, 2]$). If we swap any element with itself, we get the array [1,2,3][1,2,3]$[1, 2, 3]$, which has 3 subarrays that are permutations ([1][1]$[1]$, [1,2][1,2]$[1, 2]$, [1,2,3][1,2,3]$[1, 2, 3]$). So the best swap to make is positions 22$2$ and 33$3$.For the third sample case, after we swap elements at positions 22$2$ and 55$5$, the resulting array is [1,4,2,5,3][1,4,2,5,3]$[1, 4, 2, 5, 3]$. The only subarrays that are permutations are [1][1]$[1]$ and [1,4,2,5,3][1,4,2,5,3]$[1, 4, 2, 5, 3]$. We can show that this is minimal.
