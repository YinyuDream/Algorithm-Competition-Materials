## 题目描述

The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a tower out of them.Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts exactly 1$t$$1$ cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1$t$$1$ cube from the top of the tower. Is it possible that after n$t$$n$ moves, the resulting tower has exactly m$t$$m$ cubes?

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t$m$$t$ (1≤t≤100$m$$1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains two integers n$m$$n$ and m$m$$m$ (1≤n,m≤100$m$$1 \le n, m \le 100$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower with m$1$$m$ cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.

## 说明

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1$1$ cube on top of the tower 3$3$ times in a row, so the answer is "Yes".In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no blocks or a tower with 2$2$ blocks, so the answer is "No".
