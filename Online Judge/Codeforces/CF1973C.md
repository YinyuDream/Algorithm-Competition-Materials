## 题目描述

Fox loves permutations! She came up with the following problem and asked Cat to solve it:You are given an even positive integer n$t$$n$ and a permutation†$t$$^\dagger$ p$t$$p$ of length n$t$$n$. The score of another permutation q$t$$q$ of length n$t$$n$ is the number of local maximums in the array a$t$$a$ of length n$t$$n$, where ai=pi+qi$t$$a_i = p_i + q_i$ for all i$t$$i$ (1≤i≤n$t$$1 \le i \le n$). In other words, the score of q$t$$q$ is the number of i$t$$i$ such that 1<i<n$t$$1 < i < n$ (note the strict inequalities), ai−1<ai$t$$a_{i-1} < a_i$, and ai>ai+1$t$$a_i > a_{i+1}$ (once again, note the strict inequalities). Find the permutation q$t$$q$ that achieves the maximum score for given n$t$$n$ and p$t$$p$. If there exist multiple such permutations, you can pick any of them.†$t$$^\dagger$ A permutation of length n$t$$n$ is an array consisting of n$t$$n$ distinct integers from 1$t$$1$ to n$t$$n$ in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]$t$$[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but [1,2,2]$t$$[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation (2$t$$2$ appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]$t$$[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation (n=3$t$$n=3$ but there is 4$t$$4$ in the array).

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains an integer t$n$$t$ (1≤t≤104$n$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the input you will have to solve.The first line of each test case contains one even integer n$n$$n$ (4≤n≤105$n$$4 \leq n \leq 10^5$, n$n$$n$ is even) — the length of the permutation p$n$$p$.The second line of each test case contains the n$n$$n$ integers p1,p2,…,pn$n$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ (1≤pi≤n$n$$1 \leq p_i \leq n$). It is guaranteed that p$n$$p$ is a permutation of length n$n$$n$.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$n$$n$ across all test cases doesn't exceed 105$n$$10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing any permutation of length n$a = [3, 6, 4, 7]$$n$ (the array q$a = [3, 6, 4, 7]$$q$), such that q$a = [3, 6, 4, 7]$$q$ maximizes the score under the given constraints.

## 说明

In the first example, a=[3,6,4,7]$a = [3, 6, 4, 7]$. The array has just one local maximum (on the second position), so the score of the chosen permutation q$q$ is 1$1$. It can be proven that this score is optimal under the constraints.In the last example, the resulting array a=[6,6,12,7,14,7,14,6]$a = [6, 6, 12, 7, 14, 7, 14, 6]$ has 3$3$ local maximums — on the third, fifth and seventh positions.
