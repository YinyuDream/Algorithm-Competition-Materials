## 题目描述

You are given a cyclic array a1,a2,…,an$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.You can perform the following operation on a$a$ at most n−1$n - 1$ times: Let m$m$ be the current size of a$a$, you can choose any two adjacent elements where the previous one is no greater than the latter one (In particular, am$a_m$ and a1$a_1$ are adjacent and am$a_m$ is the previous one), and delete exactly one of them. In other words, choose an integer i$i$ (1≤i≤m$1 \leq i \leq m$) where ai≤a(imodm)+1$a_i \leq a_{(i \bmod m) + 1}$ holds, and delete exactly one of ai$a_i$ or a(imodm)+1$a_{(i \bmod m) + 1}$ from a$a$. Your goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in a$a$ equal.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t$t$ (1≤t≤500$1 \le t \le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer n$n$ (1≤n≤100$1 \le n \le 100$) — the length of the array a$a$.The second line of each test case contains n$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤n$1 \le a_i \le n$) — the elements of array a$a$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in a$a$ equal.

## 说明

In the first test case, there is only one element in a$a$, so we can't do any operation.In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make all elements in a$a$ equal: choose i=2$i = 2$, delete a3$a_3$, then a$a$ would become [1,2]$[1, 2]$. choose i=1$i = 1$, delete a1$a_1$, then a$a$ would become [2]$[2]$. It can be proven that we can't make all elements in a$a$ equal using fewer than 2$2$ operations, so the answer is 2$2$.
