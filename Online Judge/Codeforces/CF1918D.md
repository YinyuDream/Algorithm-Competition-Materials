## 题目描述

You are given an array of numbers $t$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. Your task is to block some elements of the array in order to minimize its cost. Suppose you block the elements with indices $t$$1 \leq b_1 < b_2 < \ldots < b_m \leq n$. Then the cost of the array is calculated as the maximum of: the sum of the blocked elements, i.e., $t$$a_{b_1} + a_{b_2} + \ldots + a_{b_m}$. the maximum sum of the segments into which the array is divided when the blocked elements are removed. That is, the maximum sum of the following ($t$$m + 1$) subarrays: [$t$$1, b_1 − 1$], [$t$$b_1 + 1, b_2 − 1$], [$t$$\ldots$], [$t$$b_{m−1} + 1, b_m - 1$], [$t$$b_m + 1, n$] (the sum of numbers in a subarray of the form [$t$$x,x − 1$] is considered to be $t$$0$). For example, if $t$$n = 6$, the original array is [$t$$1, 4, 5, 3, 3, 2$], and you block the elements at positions $t$$2$ and $t$$5$, then the cost of the array will be the maximum of the sum of the blocked elements ($t$$4 + 3 = 7$) and the sums of the subarrays ($t$$1$, $t$$5 + 3 = 8$, $t$$2$), which is $t$$\max(7,1,8,2) = 8$. You need to output the minimum cost of the array after blocking.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $7$$t$ ($7$$1 \leq t \leq 30\,000$) — the number of queries.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer $7$$n$ ($7$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) — the length of the array $7$$a$. The second line contains $7$$n$ elements $7$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($7$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the array $7$$a$.It is guaranteed that the sum of $7$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $7$$10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum cost of blocking the array.

## 说明

The first test case matches with the array from the statement. To obtain a cost of 7$7$, you need to block the elements at positions 2$2$ and 4$4$. In this case, the cost of the array is calculated as the maximum of: the sum of the blocked elements, which is a2+a4=7$a_2 + a_4 = 7$. the maximum sum of the segments into which the array is divided when the blocked elements are removed, i.e., the maximum of a1$a_1$, a3$a_3$, a5+a6=max(1,5,5)=5$a_5 + a_6 = \max(1,5,5) = 5$. So the cost is max(7,5)=7$\max(7,5) = 7$. In the second test case, you can block the elements at positions 1$1$ and 4$4$.In the third test case, to obtain the answer 11$11$, you can block the elements at positions 2$2$ and 5$5$. There are other ways to get this answer, for example, blocking positions 4$4$ and 6$6$.
