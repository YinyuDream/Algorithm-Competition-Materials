## 题目描述

For an array $t$$a = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$, let's denote its subarray $t$$a[l, r]$ as the array $t$$[a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r]$.For example, the array $t$$a = [1, -3, 1]$ has $t$$6$ non-empty subarrays: $t$$a[1,1] = [1]$; $t$$a[1,2] = [1,-3]$; $t$$a[1,3] = [1,-3,1]$; $t$$a[2,2] = [-3]$; $t$$a[2,3] = [-3,1]$; $t$$a[3,3] = [1]$. You are given two integers $t$$n$ and $t$$k$. Construct an array $t$$a$ consisting of $t$$n$ integers such that: all elements of $t$$a$ are from $t$$-1000$ to $t$$1000$; $t$$a$ has exactly $t$$k$ subarrays with positive sums; the rest $t$$\dfrac{(n+1) \cdot n}{2}-k$ subarrays of $t$$a$ have negative sums.

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \le t \le 5000$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $n$$n$ and $n$$k$ ($n$$2 \le n \le 30$; $n$$0 \le k \le \dfrac{(n+1) \cdot n}{2}$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, print nn$n$ integers — the elements of the array meeting the constraints. It can be shown that the answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
