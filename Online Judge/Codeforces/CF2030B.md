## 题目描述

For an arbitrary binary string t$t$$t$∗$t$$^{\text{∗}}$, let f(t)$t$$f(t)$ be the number of non-empty subsequences†$t$$^{\text{†}}$ of t$t$$t$ that contain only 0$t$$\mathtt{0}$, and let g(t)$t$$g(t)$ be the number of non-empty subsequences of t$t$$t$ that contain at least one 1$t$$\mathtt{1}$. Note that for f(t)$t$$f(t)$ and for g(t)$t$$g(t)$, each subsequence is counted as many times as it appears in t$t$$t$. E.g., f(000)=7,g(100)=4$t$$f(\mathtt{000}) = 7, g(\mathtt{100}) = 4$.We define the oneness of the binary string t$t$$t$ to be |f(t)−g(t)|$t$$|f(t)-g(t)|$, where for an arbitrary integer z$t$$z$, |z|$t$$|z|$ represents the absolute value of z$t$$z$.You are given a positive integer n$t$$n$. Find a binary string s$t$$s$ of length n$t$$n$ such that its oneness is as small as possible. If there are multiple strings, you can print any of them.∗$t$$^{\text{∗}}$A binary string is a string that only consists of characters 0$t$$\texttt{0}$ and 1$t$$\texttt{1}$.†$t$$^{\text{†}}$A sequence a$t$$a$ is a subsequence of a sequence b$t$$b$ if a$t$$a$ can be obtained from b$t$$b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. For example, subsequences of 1011101$t$$\mathtt{1011101}$ are 0$t$$\mathtt{0}$, 1$t$$\mathtt{1}$, 11111$t$$\mathtt{11111}$, 0111$t$$\mathtt{0111}$, but not 000$t$$\mathtt{000}$ nor 11100$t$$\mathtt{11100}$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer t$s$$t$ (1≤t≤104$s$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains an integer n$s$$n$ (1≤n≤2⋅105$s$$1 \leq n \leq 2\cdot10^5$) — the length of s$s$$s$.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$s$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$s$$2\cdot10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output s$f(t)=1$$s$ on a new line. If multiple answers exist, output any.

## 说明

In the first test case, for the example output, f(t)=1$f(t)=1$ because there is one subsequence that contains only 0$\mathtt{0}$ (0$\mathtt{0}$), and g(t)=0$g(t)=0$ because there are no subsequences that contain at least one 1$1$. The oneness is |1−0|=1$|1-0|=1$. The output 1$\mathtt{1}$ is correct as well because its oneness is |0−1|=1$|0-1|=1$.For the example output of the second test case, f(t)=1$f(t)=1$ because there is one non-empty subsequence that contains only 0$\mathtt{0}$, and g(t)=2$g(t)=2$ because there are two non-empty subsequences that contain at least one 1$\mathtt{1}$ (01$\mathtt{01}$ and 1$\mathtt{1}$). The oneness is thus |1−2|=1$|1-2|=1$. It can be shown that 1$1$ is the minimum possible value of its oneness over all possible binary strings of size 2$2$.
