## 题目描述

This is an interactive problem.There is a hidden permutation $t$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$. Consider an undirected graph with $t$$n$ nodes only with no edges. You can make two types of queries: Specify an integer $t$$x$ satisfying $t$$2 \le x \le 2n$. For all integers $t$$i$ ($t$$1 \le i \le n$) such that $t$$1 \le x-i \le n$, an edge between node $t$$i$ and node $t$$x-i$ will be added. Query the number of edges in the shortest path between node $t$$p_i$ and node $t$$p_j$. As the answer to this question you will get the number of edges in the shortest path if such a path exists, or $t$$-1$ if there is no such path. Note that you can make both types of queries in any order.Within $t$$2n$ queries (including type $t$$1$ and type $t$$2$), guess two possible permutations, at least one of which is $t$$p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$. You get accepted if at least one of the permutations is correct. You are allowed to guess the same permutation twice.A permutation of length $t$$n$ is an array consisting of $t$$n$ distinct integers from $t$$1$ to $t$$n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $t$$[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $t$$[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($t$$2$ appears twice in the array), and $t$$[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($t$$n=3$ but there is $t$$4$ in the array).

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$$n$ ($n$$2 \le n \le 10^3$) — the length of the permutation.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $n$$10^3$.

## 说明

In the first test case, n=6n=6$n=6$ and the hidden permutation p=[1,4,2,5,3,6]p=[1,4,2,5,3,6]$p = [1,4,2,5,3,6]$.Firstly, make a type 11$1$ query on x=12,2,3x=12,2,3$x=12, 2, 3$ respectively. This adds four edges to the graph in total: An edge that connects node 66$6$ and node 66$6$. An edge that connects node 11$1$ and node 11$1$. An edge that connects node 11$1$ and node 22$2$. An edge that connects node 22$2$ and node 11$1$. Since all of these queries are valid, the interactor returns 11$1$ after each of them.Then, query the number of edges in the shortest path between node p1=1p1=1$p_1 = 1$ and p3=2p3=2$p_3 = 2$, which is equal to 11$1$.Then, make a type 11$1$ query on x=5x=5$x=5$. This adds four edges to the graph in total: An edge that connects node 11$1$ and node 44$4$. An edge that connects node 22$2$ and node 33$3$. An edge that connects node 33$3$ and node 22$2$. An edge that connects node 44$4$ and node 11$1$. Since this query is valid, the interactor returns 11$1$.Then, query the number of edges in the shortest path between node p1=1p1=1$p_1 = 1$ and p5=3p5=3$p_5 = 3$, which is equal to 22$2$.Then, query the number of edges in the shortest path between node p4=5p4=5$p_4 = 5$ and p5=3p5=3$p_5 = 3$. Such a path doesn't exist, therefore the interactor returns −1−1$-1$.Afterwards, due to some magic, two possible permutations that can be pp$p$ are determined: the first permutation is [1,4,2,5,3,6][1,4,2,5,3,6]$[1,4,2,5,3,6]$ and the second permutation is [1,2,3,4,5,6][1,2,3,4,5,6]$[1,2,3,4,5,6]$. Since the first permutation is equal to the hidden permutation, this test case is solved correctly. In total, 77$7$ queries are used, which is within the limit of 2⋅6=122⋅6=12$2 \cdot 6 = 12$ queries.Since the answer is correct, the interactor returns 11$1$.In the second test case, n=2n=2$n=2$ and the hidden permutation is p=[2,1]p=[2,1]$p = [2,1]$.Since there are only 2!=22!=2$2! = 2$ possible permutations, no queries are needed. It is sufficient to just output the two permutations, [1,2][1,2]$[1,2]$ and [2,1][2,1]$[2,1]$. In total, 00$0$ queries are used, which is within the limit of 2⋅2=42⋅2=4$2 \cdot 2 = 4$ queries.Since the answer is correct, the interactor returns 11$1$.
