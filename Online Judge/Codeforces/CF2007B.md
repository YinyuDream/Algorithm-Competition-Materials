## 题目描述

After receiving yet another integer array a1,a2,…,an$t$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ at her birthday party, Index decides to perform some operations on it.Formally, there are m$t$$m$ operations that she is going to perform in order. Each of them belongs to one of the two types: + l r$t$$\texttt{+ l r}$. Given two integers l$t$$l$ and r$t$$r$, for all 1≤i≤n$t$$1 \leq i \leq n$ such that l≤ai≤r$t$$l \leq a_i \leq r$, set ai:=ai+1$t$$a_i := a_i + 1$. - l r$t$$\texttt{- l r}$. Given two integers l$t$$l$ and r$t$$r$, for all 1≤i≤n$t$$1 \leq i \leq n$ such that l≤ai≤r$t$$l \leq a_i \leq r$, set ai:=ai−1$t$$a_i := a_i - 1$. For example, if the initial array a=[7,1,3,4,3]$t$$a = [7, 1, 3, 4, 3]$, after performing the operation + 2 4$t$$\texttt{+} \space 2 \space 4$, the array a=[7,1,4,5,4]$t$$a = [7, 1, 4, 5, 4]$. Then, after performing the operation - 1 10$t$$\texttt{-} \space 1 \space 10$, the array a=[6,0,3,4,3]$t$$a = [6, 0, 3, 4, 3]$.Index is curious about the maximum value in the array a$t$$a$. Please help her find it after each of the m$t$$m$ operations.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t$m$$t$ (1≤t≤2⋅104$m$$1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains two integers n$m$$n$ and m$m$$m$ (1≤n≤105$m$$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$, 1≤m≤105$m$$1 \leq m \leq 10^5$) — the length of the array and the number of operations.The second line of each test case contains n$m$$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$m$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤109$m$$1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the initial array a$m$$a$.Then m$m$$m$ lines follow, each line corresponds to the operation, in the following format: c l r$m$$\texttt{c l r}$ (c∈{+,-}$m$$c \in \{\texttt +, \texttt -\}$, l$m$$l$ and r$m$$r$ are integers, 1≤l≤r≤109$m$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq 10^9$) — the description of the operation.Note that the elements ai$m$$a_i$ may not satisfy 1≤ai≤109$m$$1\le a_i\le 10^9$ after some operations, as it is shown in the example.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$m$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 105$m$$10^5$, and the sum of m$m$$m$ over all test cases does not exceed 105$m$$10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output one single line containing m$[2,3,4,3,2]$$m$ integers, with the i$[2,3,4,3,2]$$i$-th of them describing the maximum value of the array after the i$[2,3,4,3,2]$$i$-th operation.

## 说明

In the first test case, the process of the operations is listed below: After the first operation, the array becomes equal [2,3,4,3,2]$[2,3,4,3,2]$. The maximum value is 4$4$. After the second operation, the array becomes equal [1,2,4,2,1]$[1,2,4,2,1]$. The maximum value is 4$4$. After the third operation, the array becomes equal [2,3,4,3,2]$[2,3,4,3,2]$. The maximum value is 4$4$. After the fourth operation, the array becomes equal [3,4,5,4,3]$[3,4,5,4,3]$. The maximum value is 5$5$. After the fifth operation, the array becomes equal [3,4,5,4,3]$[3,4,5,4,3]$. The maximum value is 5$5$.In the second test case, the process of the operations is listed below: After the first operation, the array becomes equal [2,4,4,5,5]$[2,4,4,5,5]$. The maximum value is 5$5$. After the second operation, the array becomes equal [3,4,4,5,5]$[3,4,4,5,5]$. The maximum value is 5$5$. After the third operation, the array becomes equal [3,3,3,4,4]$[3,3,3,4,4]$. The maximum value is 4$4$. After the fourth operation, the array becomes equal [2,2,2,4,4]$[2,2,2,4,4]$. The maximum value is 4$4$. After the fifth operation, the array becomes equal [1,1,1,3,3]$[1,1,1,3,3]$. The maximum value is 3$3$.
