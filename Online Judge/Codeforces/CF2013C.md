## 题目描述

Dimash learned that Mansur wrote something very unpleasant about him to a friend, so he decided to find out his password at all costs and discover what exactly he wrote.Believing in the strength of his password, Mansur stated that his password — is a binary string of length n$t$$n$. He is also ready to answer Dimash's questions of the following type:Dimash says a binary string t$t$$t$, and Mansur replies whether it is true that t$t$$t$ is a substring of his password.Help Dimash find out the password in no more than 2n$t$$2n$ operations; otherwise, Mansur will understand the trick and stop communicating with him.

## 输入格式

## 说明

In the first example, the string 010010$010$ is given. Therefore, the answers to the queries are as follows:"? 00" 0000$00$ is not a substring of 010010$010$, so the answer is 00$0$."? 000" 000000$000$ is not a substring, so the answer is 00$0$."? 010" 010010$010$ is a substring, so the answer is 11$1$.In the second example, the string is 11001100$1100$, in the third 01100110$0110$, and in the fourth 1010$10$.
