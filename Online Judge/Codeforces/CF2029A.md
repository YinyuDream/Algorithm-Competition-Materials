## 题目描述

You are given a positive integer k$t$$k$ and a set S$t$$S$ of all integers from l$t$$l$ to r$t$$r$ (inclusive).You can perform the following two-step operation any number of times (possibly zero): First, choose a number x$t$$x$ from the set S$t$$S$, such that there are at least k$t$$k$ multiples of x$t$$x$ in S$t$$S$ (including x$t$$x$ itself); Then, remove x$t$$x$ from S$t$$S$ (note that nothing else is removed).Find the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$t$ (1≤t≤104$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$1\le t\le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The only line of each test case contains three integers l$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$l$, r$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$r$, and k$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$k$ (1≤l≤r≤109$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$1\le l\le r\leq 10^9$, 1≤k≤r−l+1$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$1\leq k\le r-l+1$) — the minimum integer in S$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$S$, the maximum integer in S$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$S$, and the parameter k$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$$k$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed.

## 说明

In the first test case, initially, S={3,4,5,6,7,8,9}$S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$. One possible optimal sequence of operations is: Choose x=4$x = 4$ for the first operation, since there are two multiples of 4$4$ in S$S$: 4$4$ and 8$8$. S$S$ becomes equal to {3,5,6,7,8,9}$\{3,5,6,7,8,9\}$; Choose x=3$x = 3$ for the second operation, since there are three multiples of 3$3$ in S$S$: 3$3$, 6$6$, and 9$9$. S$S$ becomes equal to {5,6,7,8,9}$\{5,6,7,8,9\}$. In the second test case, initially, S={4,5,6,7,8,9}$S=\{4,5,6,7,8,9\}$. One possible optimal sequence of operations is: Choose x=5$x = 5$, S$S$ becomes equal to {4,6,7,8,9}$\{4,6,7,8,9\}$; Choose x=6$x = 6$, S$S$ becomes equal to {4,7,8,9}$\{4,7,8,9\}$; Choose x=4$x = 4$, S$S$ becomes equal to {7,8,9}$\{7,8,9\}$; Choose x=8$x = 8$, S$S$ becomes equal to {7,9}$\{7,9\}$; Choose x=7$x = 7$, S$S$ becomes equal to {9}$\{9\}$; Choose x=9$x = 9$, S$S$ becomes equal to {}$\{\}$. In the third test case, initially, S={7,8,9}$S=\{7,8,9\}$. For each x$x$ in S$S$, no multiple of x$x$ other than x$x$ itself can be found in S$S$. Since k=2$k = 2$, you can perform no operations.In the fourth test case, initially, S={2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}$S=\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$. One possible optimal sequence of operations is: Choose x=2$x = 2$, S$S$ becomes equal to {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}$\{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$; Choose x=4$x = 4$, S$S$ becomes equal to {3,5,6,7,8,9,10}$\{3,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$; Choose x=3$x = 3$, S$S$ becomes equal to {5,6,7,8,9,10}$\{5,6,7,8,9,10\}$; Choose x=5$x = 5$, S$S$ becomes equal to {6,7,8,9,10}$\{6,7,8,9,10\}$.
