## 题目描述

There are n$t$$n$ nails driven into the wall, the i$t$$i$-th nail is driven ai$t$$a_i$ meters above the ground, one end of the bi$t$$b_i$ meters long rope is tied to it. All nails hang at different heights one above the other. One candy is tied to all ropes at once. Candy is tied to end of a rope that is not tied to a nail.To take the candy, you need to lower it to the ground. To do this, Rudolph can cut some ropes, one at a time. Help Rudolph find the minimum number of ropes that must be cut to get the candy.The figure shows an example of the first test:

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer tt$t$ (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains one integer nn$n$ (1≤n≤501≤n≤50$1 \le n \le 50$) — the number of nails.The ii$i$-th of the next nn$n$ lines contains two integers aiai$a_i$ and bibi$b_i$ (1≤ai,bi≤2001≤ai,bi≤200$1 \le a_i, b_i \le 200$) — the height of the ii$i$-th nail and the length of the rope tied to it, all aiai$a_i$ are different.It is guaranteed that the data is not contradictory, it is possible to build a configuration described in the statement.

## 输出格式

For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of ropes that need to be cut to make the candy fall to the ground.
