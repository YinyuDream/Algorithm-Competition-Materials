## 题目描述

Satyam is given n$t$$n$ distinct points on the 2D coordinate plane. It is guaranteed that 0≤yi≤1$t$$0 \leq y_i \leq 1$ for all given points (xi,yi)$t$$(x_i, y_i)$. How many different nondegenerate right triangles∗$t$$^{\text{∗}}$ can be formed from choosing three different points as its vertices?Two triangles a$t$$a$ and b$t$$b$ are different if there is a point v$t$$v$ such that v$t$$v$ is a vertex of a$t$$a$ but not a vertex of b$t$$b$.∗$t$$^{\text{∗}}$A nondegenerate right triangle has positive area and an interior 90∘$t$$90^{\circ}$ angle.

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer t$t$ (1≤t≤104$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer n$n$ (3≤n≤2⋅105$3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of points.The following n$n$ lines contain two integers xi$x_i$ and yi$y_i$ (0≤xi≤n$0 \leq x_i \leq n$, 0≤yi≤1$0 \leq y_i \leq 1$) — the i$i$'th point that Satyam can choose from. It is guaranteed that all (xi,yi)$(x_i, y_i)$ are pairwise distinct.It is guaranteed that the sum of n$n$ over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

Output an integer for each test case, the number of distinct nondegenerate right triangles that can be formed from choosing three points.
