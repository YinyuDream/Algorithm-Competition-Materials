## 题目描述

You are given a $t$$2 \times n$ grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at the intersection of the $t$$i$-th row and the $t$$j$-th column be $t$$a_{ij}$.There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell $t$$(1, 1)$ that can only jump one cell right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell $t$$(2, n)$. Consider the binary string of length $t$$n+1$ consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order.Your goal is to: Find the lexicographically smallest$t$$^\dagger$ string you can attain by choosing any available path; Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. $t$$^\dagger$ If two strings $t$$s$ and $t$$t$ have the same length, then $t$$s$ is lexicographically smaller than $t$$t$ if and only if in the first position where $t$$s$ and $t$$t$ differ, the string $t$$s$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $t$$t$.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $\mathtt{000}$$t$ ($\mathtt{000}$$1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $\mathtt{000}$$n$ ($\mathtt{000}$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).The second line of each test case contains a binary string $\mathtt{000}$$a_{11} a_{12} \ldots a_{1n}$ ($\mathtt{000}$$a_{1i}$ is either $\mathtt{000}$$0$ or $\mathtt{000}$$1$).The third line of each test case contains a binary string $\mathtt{000}$$a_{21} a_{22} \ldots a_{2n}$ ($\mathtt{000}$$a_{2i}$ is either $\mathtt{000}$$0$ or $\mathtt{000}$$1$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $\mathtt{000}$$n$ over all test cases does not exceed $\mathtt{000}$$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output two lines: The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; The number of paths that yield this string.

## 说明

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is 000$\mathtt{000}$. There are two paths that yield this string: In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is 11000$\mathtt{11000}$. There is only one path that yields this string:
