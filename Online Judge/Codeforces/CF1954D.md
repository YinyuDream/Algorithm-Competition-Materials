## 题目描述

There are balls of n$n$ different colors; the number of balls of the i$i$-th color is ai$a_i$.The balls can be combined into groups. Each group should contain at most 2$2$ balls, and no more than 1$1$ ball of each color.Consider all 2n$2^n$ sets of colors. For a set of colors, let's denote its value as the minimum number of groups the balls of those colors can be distributed into. For example, if there are three colors with 3$3$, 1$1$ and 7$7$ balls respectively, they can be combined into 7$7$ groups (and not less than 7$7$), so the value of that set of colors is 7$7$.Your task is to calculate the sum of values over all 2n$2^n$ possible sets of colors. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo 998244353$998\,244\,353$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer n$n$ (1≤n≤5000$1 \le n \le 5000$) — the number of colors.The second line contains n$n$ integers a1,a2,…,an$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ (1≤ai≤5000$1 \le a_i \le 5000$) — the number of balls of the i$i$-th color.Additional constraint on input: the total number of balls doesn't exceed 5000$5000$.

## 输出格式

Print a single integer — the sum of values of all 2n$2^n$ sets of colors, taken modulo 998244353$998\,244\,353$.

## 说明

Consider the first example. There are 8$8$ sets of colors: for the empty set, its value is 0$0$; for the set {1}$\{1\}$, its value is 1$1$; for the set {2}$\{2\}$, its value is 1$1$; for the set {3}$\{3\}$, its value is 2$2$; for the set {1,2}$\{1,2\}$, its value is 1$1$; for the set {1,3}$\{1,3\}$, its value is 2$2$; for the set {2,3}$\{2,3\}$, its value is 2$2$; for the set {1,2,3}$\{1,2,3\}$, its value is 2$2$. So, the sum of values over all 2n$2^n$ sets of colors is 11$11$.
