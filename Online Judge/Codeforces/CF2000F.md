## 题目描述

You have n$t$$n$ rectangles, the i$t$$i$-th of which has a width of ai$t$$a_i$ and a height of bi$t$$b_i$.You can perform the following operation an unlimited number of times: choose a rectangle and a cell in it, and then color it.Each time you completely color any row or column, you earn 1$t$$1$ point. Your task is to score at least k$t$$k$ points with as few operations as possible.Suppose you have a rectangle with a width of 6$t$$6$ and a height of 3$t$$3$. You can score 4$t$$4$ points by coloring all the cells in any 4$t$$4$ columns, thus performing 12$t$$12$ operations.

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer t$k$$t$ (1≤t≤100$k$$1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The following are the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case description contains two integers n$k$$n$ and k$k$$k$ (1≤n≤1000,1≤k≤100$k$$1 \le n \le 1000, 1 \le k \le 100$) — the number of rectangles in the case and the required number of points.The next n$k$$n$ lines contain the descriptions of the rectangles. The i$k$$i$-th line contains two integers ai$k$$a_i$ and bi$k$$b_i$ (1≤ai,bi≤100$k$$1 \le a_i, b_i \le 100$) — the width and height of the i$k$$i$-th rectangle.It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n$k$$n$ across all test cases does not exceed 1000$k$$1000$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to score at least kk$k$ points. If it is impossible to score at least kk$k$ points, output -1.
