## 题目描述

The mathematicians of the 31st lyceum were given the following task:You are given an odd number $t$$n$, and you need to find $t$$n$ different numbers that are squares of integers. But it's not that simple. Each number should have a length of $t$$n$ (and should not have leading zeros), and the multiset of digits of all the numbers should be the same. For example, for $t$$\mathtt{234}$ and $t$$\mathtt{432}$, and $t$$\mathtt{11223}$ and $t$$\mathtt{32211}$, the multisets of digits are the same, but for $t$$\mathtt{123}$ and $t$$\mathtt{112233}$, they are not.The mathematicians couldn't solve this problem. Can you?

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of test cases.The following $n$$t$ lines contain one odd integer $n$$n$ ($n$$1 \leq n \leq 99$) — the number of numbers to be found and their length.It is guaranteed that the solution exists within the given constraints.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$$n^2$ does not exceed $n$$10^5$.The numbers can be output in any order.

## 输出格式

For each test case, you need to output $\mathtt{169}$$n$ numbers of length $\mathtt{169}$$n$ — the answer to the problem.If there are several answers, print any of them.

## 说明

Below are the squares of the numbers that are the answers for the second test case:169$\mathtt{169}$ = 132$\mathtt{13}^2$196$\mathtt{196}$ = 142$\mathtt{14}^2$961$\mathtt{961}$ = 312$\mathtt{31}^2$Below are the squares of the numbers that are the answers for the third test case:16384$\mathtt{16384}$ = 1282$\mathtt{128}^2$31684$\mathtt{31684}$ = 1782$\mathtt{178}^2$36481$\mathtt{36481}$ = 1912$\mathtt{191}^2$38416$\mathtt{38416}$ = 1962$\mathtt{196}^2$43681$\mathtt{43681}$ = 2092$\mathtt{209}^2$
