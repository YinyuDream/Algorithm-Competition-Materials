## 题目描述

In Berland, there are two types of coins, having denominations of $t$$2$ and $t$$k$ burles.Your task is to determine whether it is possible to represent $t$$n$ burles in coins, i. e. whether there exist non-negative integers $t$$x$ and $t$$y$ such that $t$$2 \cdot x + k \cdot y = n$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $n$$t$ ($n$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $n$$n$ and $n$$k$ ($n$$1 \le k \le n \le 10^{18}$; $n$$k \ne 2$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to represent $2$$n$ burles in coins; otherwise, print NO. You may print each letter in any case (YES, yes, Yes will all be recognized as positive answer, NO, no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).

## 说明

In the first test case, you can take one coin with denomination 22$2$ and one coin with denomination k=3k=3$k = 3$.In the second test case, you can take three coins with denomination 22$2$. Alternatively, you can take six coins with denomination k=1k=1$k = 1$.In the third test case, there is no way to represent 77$7$ burles.In the fourth test case, you can take one coin with denomination k=8k=8$k = 8$.
