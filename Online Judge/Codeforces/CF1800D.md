## 题目描述

Dmitry has a string $t$$s$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.Dmitry decided to remove two consecutive characters from the string $t$$s$ and you are wondering how many different strings can be obtained after such an operation.For example, Dmitry has a string "aaabcc". You can get the following different strings: "abcc"(by deleting the first two or second and third characters), "aacc"(by deleting the third and fourth characters),"aaac"(by deleting the fourth and the fifth character) and "aaab" (by deleting the last two).

## 输入格式

The first line of input data contains a single integer tt$t$ (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.The first line of the description of each test case contains an integer nn$n$ (3≤n≤2⋅1053≤n≤2⋅105$3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).The second line of the description of each test case contains a string ss$s$ of length nn$n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.It is guaranteed that the sum of nn$n$ for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105$2 \cdot 10^5$.

## 输出格式

For each test case print one integer — the number of distinct strings that can be obtained by removing two consecutive letters.
