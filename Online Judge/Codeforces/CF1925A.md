## 题目描述

You are given two positive integers $t$$n$ and $t$$k$. Your task is to find a string $t$$s$ such that all possible strings of length $t$$n$ that can be formed using the first $t$$k$ lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of $t$$s$. If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.Note: A string $t$$a$ is called a subsequence of another string $t$$b$ if $t$$a$ can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from $t$$b$ without changing the order of the remaining characters.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer $s$$t$ ($s$$1\leq t\leq 676$) denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers $s$$n$ ($s$$1\leq n\leq 26$) and $s$$k$ ($s$$1\leq k\leq 26$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string $1$$s$ which satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

## 说明

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1$1$ which can be formed using the first 2$2$ lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s$s$ as a subsequence as follows: a:ab$\texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b}$ b:ab$\texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}$ For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2$2$ which can be formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s$s$ as a subsequence as follows: aa:aa$\texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}$ For the third test case, there are 4$4$ strings of length 2$2$ which can be formed using the first 2$2$ lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s$s$ as a subsequence as follows: aa:baab$\texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b}$ ab:baab$\texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}$ ba:baab$\texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab}$ bb:baab$\texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}$ For the fourth test case, there are 9$9$ strings of length 2$2$ which can be formed using the first 3$3$ lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s$s$ as a subsequence as follows: aa:abcbac$\texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c}$ ab:abcbac$\texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac}$ ac:abcbac$\texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}}$ ba:abcbac$\texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c}$ bb:abcbac$\texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac}$ bc:abcbac$\texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac}$ ca:abcbac$\texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c}$ cb:abcbac$\texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac}$ cc:abcbac$\texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}$
