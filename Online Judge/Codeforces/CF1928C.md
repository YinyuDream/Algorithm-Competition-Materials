## 题目描述

In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual, everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–$t$$k$-th" position.As is known, settling in "the first–$t$$k$-th" position occurs as follows: the first $t$$k$ people have numbers $t$$1, 2, 3, \ldots, k$, the next $t$$k - 2$ people have numbers $t$$k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2$, the next $t$$k$ people have numbers $t$$1, 2, 3, \ldots, k$, and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every $t$$2k - 2$ positions. Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number $t$$k$ described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how many natural numbers $t$$k$ fit under the given constraints.Note that the settling exists if and only if $t$$k > 1$. In particular, this means that the settling does not exist for $t$$k = 1$.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $k$$t$ ($k$$1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.The only line of each test case contains two integers $k$$n$ and $k$$x$ ($k$$1 \le x < n \le 10^9$) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different $k$$k$ that fit under the given constraints.It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

## 说明

In the first test case, kk$k$ equals 2,3,5,62,3,5,6$2, 3, 5, 6$ are suitable.An example of settling for these kk$k$: kk$k$ / №11$1$22$2$33$3$44$4$55$5$66$6$77$7$88$8$99$9$1010$10$22$2$11$1$22$2$11$1$22$2$11$1$22$2$11$1$22$2$11$1$22$2$33$3$11$1$22$2$33$3$22$2$11$1$22$2$33$3$22$2$11$1$22$2$55$5$11$1$22$2$33$3$44$4$55$5$44$4$33$3$22$2$11$1$22$2$66$6$11$1$22$2$33$3$44$4$55$5$66$6$55$5$44$4$33$3$22$2$ In the second test case, k=2k=2$k = 2$ is suitable.
