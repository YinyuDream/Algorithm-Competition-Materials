## 题目描述

Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty $t$$x$ and decided to make it the second problem for Codeforces Round #921. But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a problemset of $t$$n$ sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to $t$$x$. The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset. Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties of the sub-problems optimally.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer $10$$t$ ($10$$1\leq t\leq 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases.Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers $10$$x$ ($10$$1\leq x\leq 10^8$) and $10$$n$ ($10$$1\leq n\leq x$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

## 说明

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of difficulty 1010$10$ into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 44$4$, 22$2$ and 44$4$ respectively, giving a balance equal to 22$2$.For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of difficulty 55$5$ into a problemset of 55$5$ problems with each problem having a difficulty 11$1$ giving a balance equal to 11$1$.
