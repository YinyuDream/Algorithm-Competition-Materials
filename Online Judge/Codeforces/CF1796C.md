## 题目描述

A set of positive integers S$t$$S$ is called beautiful if, for every two integers x$t$$x$ and y$t$$y$ from this set, either x$t$$x$ divides y$t$$y$ or y$t$$y$ divides x$t$$x$ (or both).You are given two integers l$t$$l$ and r$t$$r$. Consider all beautiful sets consisting of integers not less than l$t$$l$ and not greater than r$t$$r$. You have to print two numbers: the maximum possible size of a beautiful set where all elements are from l$t$$l$ to r$t$$r$; the number of beautiful sets consisting of integers from l$t$$l$ to r$t$$r$ with the maximum possible size. Since the second number can be very large, print it modulo 998244353$t$$998244353$.

## 输入格式

The first line contains one integer t$l$$t$ (1≤t≤2⋅104$l$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two integers l$l$$l$ and r$l$$r$ (1≤l≤r≤106$l$$1 \le l \le r \le 10^6$).

## 输出格式

For each test case, print two integers — the maximum possible size of a beautiful set consisting of integers from l$3$$l$ to r$3$$r$, and the number of such sets with maximum possible size. Since the second number can be very large, print it modulo 998244353$3$$998244353$.

## 说明

In the first test case, the maximum possible size of a beautiful set with integers from 33$3$ to 1111$11$ is 22$2$. There are 44$4$ such sets which have the maximum possible size: {3,6}{3,6}$\{ 3, 6 \}$; {3,9}{3,9}$\{ 3, 9 \}$; {4,8}{4,8}$\{ 4, 8 \}$; {5,10}{5,10}$\{ 5, 10 \}$.
