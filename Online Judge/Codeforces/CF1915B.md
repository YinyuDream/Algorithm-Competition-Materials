## 题目描述

A Latin square is a $t$$3 \times 3$ grid made up of the letters $t$$\texttt{A}$, $t$$\texttt{B}$, and $t$$\texttt{C}$ such that: in each row, the letters $t$$\texttt{A}$, $t$$\texttt{B}$, and $t$$\texttt{C}$ each appear once, and in each column, the letters $t$$\texttt{A}$, $t$$\texttt{B}$, and $t$$\texttt{C}$ each appear once. For example, one possible Latin square is shown below. $t$You are given a Latin square, but one of the letters was replaced with a question mark $t$$\texttt{?}$. Find the letter that was replaced.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer tt$t$ (1≤t≤1081≤t≤108$1 \leq t \leq 108$) — the number of testcases.Each test case contains three lines, each consisting of three characters, representing the Latin square. Each character is one of AA$\texttt{A}$, BB$\texttt{B}$, CC$\texttt{C}$, or ??$\texttt{?}$.Each test case is a Latin square with exactly one of the letters replaced with a question mark ??$\texttt{?}$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the letter that was replaced.
