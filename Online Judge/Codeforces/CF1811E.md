## 题目描述

In Japan, the number $t$$4$ reads like death, so Bob decided to build a live sequence. Living sequence $t$$a$ contains all natural numbers that do not contain the digit $t$$4$. $t$$a = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, \ldots]$.For example, the number $t$$1235$ is part of the sequence $t$$a$, but the numbers $t$$4321$, $t$$443$ are not part of the sequence $t$$a$.Bob realized that he does not know how to quickly search for a particular number by the position $t$$k$ in the sequence, so he asks for your help.For example, if Bob wants to find the number at position $t$$k = 4$ (indexing from $t$$1$), you need to answer $t$$a_k = 5$.

## 输入格式

The first line of input data contains a single integer $a_k$$t$ ($a_k$$1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.In the only line of each test case, there is a single integer $a_k$$k$ ($a_k$$1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) — the position Bob is interested in.

## 输出格式

For each test case, print on a separate line the number akak$a_k$ in indexing with 11$1$.
